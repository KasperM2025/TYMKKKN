Attn Asst to Secy for Legislative Affairs. Re-
quest you pass following to Senator Mansfield soonest.

Dear Senator Mansfield: Your letter of 5 May
passed to me by DOD received Saigon 19 May. Full reply
enroute by airmail. As interim reply UPI dispatch number
31, May 5, 1960 to which you refer not entirely factual.
Specifically US training staff not being doubled as stated
in UPI dispatch. The 350 US"civilian technicians" mentioned
in news items as sorting and shipping arms left by French
forces undoubtedly refers to US military personnel of the
temporary equipment recovery mission, short title TERM, now
in process deactivation. Maintenance of total overall
MAGG-TERM advisor strength of 385 for time being is at
urgent request GVN with full concurrence Ambassador, CINCPAC,
DOD, State Department and myself. Total advisor strength
to be considerably lower than total 850 US and French MAAG |
at time of Geneva accords and slightly lower than total
MAAG-TERM strength. Following sentence classified CONFIDENTIAL:
Change over of TERM excess to MAAG ends subterfuge as
actually TERM has had undercover mission as logistical
advisors since activation. Project began before current
step-up guerrilla activities. Small number US experts in
guerrilla warfare recently brought in on TDY as substitutes
for regular MAAG advisors and are within previous overall
strength. It is my personal opinion MAAG should and can
work itself “out of job" with possible reduction approximately
15 per cent in June 61 and approximately 20 per cent reduction
