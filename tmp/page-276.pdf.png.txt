-3- 624, SEPTEMBER 16, 6 PM (SECTION ONE OF TWO) FROM SAIGON

(A) BECAUSE OF VICE PRESIDENT THO'S KNOWLEDGE OF SOUTH WHERE
COMMUNIST GUERRILLA INFILTRATION IS SPREADING SO RAPIDLY I
WOULD SUGGEST â€˜THAT HE BE SHIFTED FROM MINISTRY NATIONAL ECONOMY
TO MINISTRY INTERIOR, (DIEM HAS ALREADY MADE THIS SUGGESTION
BUT VICE PRESIDENT MOST RELUCTANT TAKE JOB.)

(B) IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMOVE ANY FEELING WITHIN ARMED FORCES
THAT FAVORITISM AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS MOTIVATE PROMO-
TIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS. ALSO VITAL IN ORDER DEAL EFFECTIVELY
WITH VIET-CONG THREAT THAT CHANNELS OR COMMAND BE FOLLOWED
BOTH DOWN AND UP. TO ASSIST IN BRINGING ABOUT THESE CHANGES
IN ARMED FORCES, I WOULD SUGGEST APPOINTMENT OF FULL-TIME
MINISTER NATIONAL DEFENSE. (THUAN HAS INDICATED DIEM HAS BEEN
THINKING OF GIVING THUAN DEFENSE JOB.)

(Cc) RUMORS ABOUT MR. AND MRS. NHU ARE CREATING GROWING DISSEN-
SION WITHIN COUNTRY AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGE POLITICAL POSITION OF
DIEM GOVERNMENT. WHETHER RUMORS TRUE OR FALSE, POLITICALLY
IMPORTANT FACT IS THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BELIEVE THEM TO BE
TRUE. THEREFORE, BECOMING INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT IN INTEREST
DIEM GOVERNMENT SOME ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN, IN ANALAGOUS
SITUATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING US IMPORTANT, USEFUL
GOVERNMENT PERSONALITIES HAVE HAD TO BE SACRIFICED FOR POLITI-
CAL REASONS, I WOULD SUGGEST THEREFORE THAT PRESIDENT MIGHT
APPOINT NHU TO AMBASSADORSHIP ABROAD,

(D) SIMILARLY TRAN KIM TUYEN, NHU'S HENCHMAN AND HEAD OF
SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, SHOULD BE SENT ABROAD IN DIPLO-
MATIC CAPACITY BECAUSE OF HIS GROWING IDENTIFICATION IN PUBLIC
MIND WITH ALLEGED SECRET POLICE METHODS OF REPRESSION AND

DURBROW
