-2 624, SEPTEMBER 16, 6 PM (SECTION TWO OF TWO) FROM SAIGON

6. RELAX EXISTING MINISTRY OF INFORMATION CONTROL OVER COGENT
OF THE VIETNAMESE PUBLIC MEDIA (PRESS,MAGAZINES, RADIO),

SO THAT THEY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO WIDER DISSEMINATION OF FACTS

TO DISPEL RUMORS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO RECOMMENDATIONS

kh AND 5 ABOVE, AND THUS TO CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT
AND ITS PEOPLE BY TRANSMITTING IDEAS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.

TO INSURE THAT THE PRESS WOULD REFLECT, AS WELL AS LEAD,

PUBLIC OPINION WITHOUT BECOMING A MEANS OF UPSETTING THE ENTIRE
GVN STRUCTURE, IT SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE TO A SELF-

IMPOSED CODE OF ETHICS OR "CANON" OF PRESS-CONDUCT.

7. LAUNCH MAJOR PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN ABOUT NEW 3-YEAR DEVELOP-
MENT PLAN IN EFFORT CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT GOVERNMENT GENUINELY
AIMS AT IMPROVING THEIR WELFARE. (THIS SUGGESTION DEPENDENT
OF COURSE UPON ASSESSMENT OF SOUNDNESS OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN,
WHICH HAS JUST REACHED US.)

8. ADOPT FOLLOWING MEASURES FOR IMMEDIATE ENHANCEMENT OF
PEASANT SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENT: (A) ESTABLISH MECHANISM FOR
INCREASING PRICE PEASANT WILL RECEIVE FOR PADDY CROP BEGINNING
TO COME ON MARKET IN DECEMBER, EITHER BY DIRECT SUBSIDIZATION
OR ESTABLISHMENT STATE PURCHASING MECHANISM; (B) INSTITUTE
MODEST PAYMENT FOR ALL CORVEE LABOR: (C) SUBSIDIZE AGROVILLE
FAMILIES ALONG SAME LINES AS LAND RESETTLEMENT FAMILIES UNTIL
FORMER ON FEET ECONOMICALLY; (D) INCREASE COMPENSATION PAID TO
YOUTH CORPS. IF DIEM ASKS HOW THESE MEASURES ARE TO BE FINANCED
I SHALL SUGGEST THROUGH INCREASED TAXES OR INSREASED DEFICIT
FINANCING, AND SHALL NOTE THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
REASONABLE DEFICIT FINANCING BECOMES A POLITICALLY NECESSARY
MEASURE FOR GOVERNMENTS. I SHOULD ADD THAT USING REVENUES FOR
THESE FUNDAMENTAL AND WORTHY PURPOSES WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE
THAN SPENDING LARGER AND LARGER SUMS ON SECURITY FORCES,

WHICH, WHILE THEY ARE ESSENTIAL AND SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR
EXISTING SECURITY FORCES MAY BE REQUIRED, ARE NOT COMPLETE
ANSWER TO CURRENT PROBLEMS.

9. PROPOSE SUGGEST TO DIEM THAT APPROPORIATE STEPS OUTLINED
ABOVE BE ANNOUNCED DRAMATICALLY IN HIS ANNUAL STATE OF UNION
