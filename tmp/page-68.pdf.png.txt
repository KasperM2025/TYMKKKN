although the Communists, often working underground, may have made gains of
their own., The coup in Thailand, the repercussions of which are still to be
felt, over-shadowed all other developments. If Thailand orients itself toward

staff was strengthened, and the September Military Advisers' meeting was highly
successful. There was modest progress in developing SEATO economic and social
programs. Nevertheless, the generation of public attitudes favorable to col-
