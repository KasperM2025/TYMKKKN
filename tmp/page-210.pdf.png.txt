MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR, JOINT STAFF
ATTENTION: DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: North Viet-Namese Military Establishment and
Capabilities

The International Control Commission (ICC) has requested
that the Government of Vietnam furnish them information re-
garding U.S. plans for reduction and/or phase out of TERM in
Vietnam. The Department of Defense has requested that the
Department of State obtain approval from the ICC for an increase
in the MAAG ceiling before providing the information requested.
The Departments of State and Defense have agreed that Canadian
and Indian members of the ICC should be briefed and requested
to support the U.S. position. In order to bolster the case
for an expanded U.S. training program, it is requested that
the Director of Intelligence, Joint Staff, prepare an esti-
mate of North Viet-Namese capabilities and appraise the un-
stable political and military conditions in Laos. It is
recommended that the estimate be prepared with marginal notes
indicating what information is releasable respectively to
Canadian and Indian nationals.
