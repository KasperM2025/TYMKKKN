suggested political actions, a French translation of which was read and
then handed to President Diem by Ambassador Durbrow on October 14, 1960.
The French translation which was left with President Diem was classified
"Top Secret" for the purpose of impressing Diem. For United States’ pur-
“poses, however, we consider the classification of both the English and
- French texts to be Secret.

gested transfer of Ngo Dinh Nhu and Dr. Tran Kim Tuyen, a French translation
of which was read to President Diem by Ambassador Durbrow at the same time.
