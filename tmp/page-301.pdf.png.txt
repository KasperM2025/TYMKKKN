-2- 1151, December 4, 2PM, (SECTION TWO OF TWO) FROM SATGON

6. DO ALL WE CAN GET DIEM TO ACCEPT BASIC PRINCIPLES SUGGESTED IN
MAAG COUNTER-TNSURGENCY PLAN, WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED SONNEST
(SOME PARTS OF PLAN WHICH WITHIN U.S. AGREED POLICY

DIRECTIVES HAVE BEEN URGED ON GVN WITH SOME SUCCESS).

7. CLARIFY INCONSISTENCIES IN TRANSFER CIVIL GUARD TO DOD IN
ORDER THAT MAAG MAY START TRATNING ON LARGE SCALE SOONEST
AND MAKE MAP EQUIPMENT AVATLABLE, -

8. SINCE DIEM BELIEVES WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND SERIOUSNESS OF VC,
THREAT AND HE SUSPECTS WE MAY HAVE ENCOURAGED REBELS, WE SHOULD MAKE
ARRANGEMENTS IMMEDIATELY TO SHIP SIX H-34 HELICOPTERS WHICH

ARE NOT ONLY MOST URGENTLY NEEDED FIGHT VC EFFECTIVELY BUT

WOULD REASSURE DIEM WE TRYING GIVE EFFECTIVE HELP.

9. SINCE IT FAR FROM CERTAIN DIEM WILL INTRODUCE SUFFICIENTLY
APPEALING AND EFFECTIVE NEW PROGRAMS AND USE HIS PRESENT
SECURITY FORCES IN MOST EFFICACIOUS MANNER, WE MUST FIND SUITABLE
MEANS TO BRING PRESSURE ON HIM. AS I OUTLINED IN EMBTEL 1105

AS WELL AS IN MEMORANDUM THIS SUBJECT (LETTER TO PARSONS NOV 8)

I AM CONVINCED, EVEN IF WE EVENTUALLY SHOULD AGREE, THAT WE SHOULD
NOT NOW ACCORD HIS REQUEST FOR 20,000 ADDITIONAL FORCE OR

CONCUR IN HIS UNILATERAL ACTION TO RAISE FORCE LEVEL

(CHIEF MAAG 1537 DEC 1 - COPY JCS). TO DO SO WITHOUT

HIS HAVING RELAXED CONTROLS, INSTITUTED EFFECTIVE REFORMS AND
HAVING PERMITTED EFFICIENT USE PRESENT FORCES, WOULD NOT SAVE
THE DAY FOR DIEM BUT MIGHT EVEN INDUCE HIM FOLLOW HIS INSTINCT
TO RELY PRIMARILY ON USE OF FORCE BOTH TO CONTROL POPULATION

AND FIGHT VC. WHILE I AM NOT FULLY CONVINCED NEED FOR EXTRA
20,000 MEN, I WOULD BE WILLING TO CONCUR IN SUCH ADDITION IF
CAREFUL STUDY BY ALL CONCERNED CONCURRED IN THIS RECOMMENDATION.
(MAAG VIEWS ON URGENT NEED FOR 20,000 INCREASE FORWARDED

PARSONS MY LETTER NOV 30TH) THEREFORE, SUGGESTED THIS MATTER BE
CAREFULLY STUDIED WASHINGTON AND IF FINAL RECOMMENDATION

IS FAVORABLE IT BE KEP SECRET AS ACE IN THE HOLE TO GRANT

DIEM PROVIDED HE HAS TAKEN OTHER NECESSARY STEPS WHICH ARE TO

- ME MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL, AND PROVIDED HE NEEDS EXTRA FORCE
AFTER TAKING MORE ESSENTIAL STEPS. IF, FOR INSTANCE, AT THE
BEGINNING NEXT YEAR HE HAS TAKEN EFFECTIVE STEPS ALONG LINES
SUGGESTED ABOVE AND IT IS STILL CONSIDERED HE NEEDS INCREASED
