-3- 624, SEPTEMBER 16, 6 PM (SECTION TWO OF TWO) FROM SAIGON

MESSAGE TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN EARLY OCTOBER. SINCE DIEM
USUALLY DELIVERS MESSAGE IN PERSON THIS WOULD HAVE MAXIMUM
EFFECT, AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IT BE BROADCAST LIVE TO
COUNTRY.

10. AT SOME STAGE, PERHAPS ON OCCASION FIFTH ANNIVERSARY
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM ON OCTOBER 26, IT MAY

BECOME HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR PRESIDENT EISENHOWER TO ADDRESS

A LETTER OF CONTINUED US SUPPORT TO DIEM, DIEM HAS UNDOUBTEDLY
NOTICED THAT EISENHOWER LETTER RECENTLY DELIVERED TO SINANOUK,.
NOT ONLY FOR THIS REASON BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT MAY BECOME VERY
IMPORTANT FOR US TO GIVE DIEM CONTINUED REASSURANCE OF OUR
SUPPORT, PRESIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH COULD BE PUBLISHED HERE MAY
PROVE TO BE VERY VALUABLE.

REQUEST ANY ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS DEPARTMENT MAY HAVE AND ITS
APPROVAL FOR APPROACH TO DIEM ALONG LINES PARAS 1 TO 9.

WE BELIEVE US SHOULD AT THIS TIME SUPPORT DIEM AS BEST AVATLABLE
VIETNAMESE LEADER, BUT SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT OVERRIDING US
OBJECTIVE IS STRONGLY ANTI-COMMUNIST VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT
WHICH CAN COMMAND LOYAL AND ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT OF WIDEST
POSSIBLE SEGMENTS OF VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, AND IS ABLE TO CARRY
ON EFFECTIVE FIGHT AGATNST COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS, IF DIEM'S
POSITION IN COUNTRY CONTINUES DETERIORATE AS RESULT FATLURE
ADOP? PROPER POLITICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SECURITY
MEASURES, IT MAY BECOME NECESSARY FOR US GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN
CONSIDERATION ALTERNATIVE COURSES OF ACTION AND LEADERS IN
ORDER ACHTEVE OUR OBJECTIVE.
