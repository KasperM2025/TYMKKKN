At this point Secretary Quarles noted that the President
‘was due at the Press Club oC and requested time for a few
U.S, questions. His first was whether the Geneva Accords
inhibited (US) training personnel. President Diem replied
that there had been no protests ~ there had been onbarrassing
questions, but .the Geneva Accords only prohibited troop rein-

forcenents.

Mr, Quarles asked a general question on the status of
training and equipment of the Viet~Nan air force, General Bon
replied that the plenes turned over by the French had been
retained foxy training until no longer usable and then returned.
President Ngo said that in gencral vehicles and communications
equipment were in bad shape, These can be replaced with the

same type used by the French without violating the Geneva
Accords. . He continued to say that the French training of the
air force and navy in his opinion was very poor because the
French were dragging their feet, For the Viet-Nam Air Force
actually they were providing only.6 months training for nechanics
which U,S. military personnel considered inadequate. When the
French questioned him about the renewal of their training
contract the conversation resulted in an agreement to withdraw
the French Air Force training mission with the exception of
special French personne] who would remain until the end of the
year for technical training. All other requirements would be
met by the U.S, He had therefore requested the MAAG provide
these training personnel and several instructors for the mnili-
tary academy (Armed Forces Académy).. ;

After: brief closing, remark by Sccretary Quarles the
session ended,
