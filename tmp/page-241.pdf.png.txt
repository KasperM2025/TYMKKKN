UPI -- (#31, May 5, 1960)

The U.S. is doubling its military training staff in South Vietnam and
stepping up the training of Vietnamese troops for guerrilla warfare against

Communist terrorists.

The decision reflects concern about the mounting strength and boldness of
Communist bands which are raiding villages and assassinating Vietnamese
officials. However, U.S. military and diplomatic officials said the
Communist campaign is not a “crisis” and in itself, is not likely to

become a major threat to the government of President Ngo Dinh Diem.

Guerrilla warfare specialists will be included among about 350 additional

American military training officers and men sent to Vietnam.
