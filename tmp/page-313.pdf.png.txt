PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT MENTIONED CORVEE LABOR THIS TIME,
DIEM STATED THIS ONLY WAY COLLECT EQUIVALENT OF TAXES FROM
PEASANTS AND THAT THIS SYSTEM IS IN VIETNAMESE TRADITION,
BUT PEASANTS IN COCHIN-CHINA UNDER FRENCH HAD NOT BEEN ASKED
TO CONTRIBUTE LABOR. THEREFORE THEY NOW RESENT CORVEE LABOR
AND OF COURSE WOULD NOT THINK OF PAYING ANY MONETARY TAXES.
HE POINTED OUT PEASANTS IN CENTRAL VIET-NAM WILLINGLY CONTRI-
BUTE FREE LABOR INSTEAD OF TAXES. I REMARKED ONE REASON FOR
DISCONTENT IN SOUTH IS ARBITRARY ACTION OF OFFICIALS AND THE
FAILURE TO EXPLAIN NEEDS TO PEASANTS BEFORE FORCING THEM

TO WORK. DIEM INSISTED PEASANTS HAD BEEN TOLD OF NEEDS BUT
THEY JUST LAZY.

DIEM THEN STATED WHILE IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO FIND WAYS AND
MEANS TO RAISE TAXES IN GENERAL, THIS HAD TO BE DONE VERY
CAREFULLY IN ORDER TO AVOID A TOO-HIGH RISE IN PRICES

WHICH WOULD CAUSE FURTHER DISGRUNTLEMENT. HE ADDED DEVALUA-
TION WOULD HAVE SAME EFFECT AND THEREFORE THIS COULD NOT BE
DONE IN HURRY. IN THIS CONNECTION HE AGAIN STATED THAT LAO
DEVALUATION BEEN A FATLURE AND WAS ONE OF THE CAUSES

FOR THE CURRENT TROUBLES THERE, I REPEATED, AS I HAD SEVERAL
TIMES, THAT WE CONSIDERED LAO DEVALUATION AS BENEFICIAL AND
SUCCESSFUL.

TOWARD END OF CONVERSATION DIEM REVERTED AGAIN TO USELESS
INTELLECTUALS WHO NOW SPREADING REPORTS OF ANOTHER COUP ON
CHRISTMAS OR ON JANUARY 2Â¢th.

ON FEW OCCASIONS HE LET ME TALK, I URGED HE ADOPT REFORMS
SOONEST SINCE IT ESSENTIAL TO WIN FURTHER SUPPORT OF THE
PEOPLE IF VIET CONG MENACE IS TO BE OVERCOME, BUT HE GAVE ME
NO INDICATION OF REFORMS HE MAY ADOPT, BEFORE LEAVING I
AGAIN EXPRESSED HOPE THAT HE WOULD ACCEPI OUR SUGGESTION THAT
HE ANNOUNCE ALL LIBERALIZING PROGRAMS AT ONE TIME IN ORDER
TO MAKE BEST IMPACT. DIEM REPLIED HE WOULD THING ABOUT THIS
BUT MADE NO COMMITMENT,

COMMENTS. WE HAVE HEARD THAT NHU, THUAN AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN
RUNNING INTO RESISTANCE WHEN URGING DIEM TO ADOPT? WORTHWHILE
