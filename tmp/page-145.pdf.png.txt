MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Subject: Airfields for Vietnam (U)

1. Reference is made to the memorandum by the Joint Chief
of Staff, for the Secretary of Defense, dated 18 December 1958,
subject, "Jet Aircraft for Vietnam (U)."

2. Subparagraph 4 b of the referenced memorandum states
that it is deemed advisable to request the International
Cooperation Administration to include Cap St Jacques in
addition to Tan Son Nhut in their program for airfield im-
provement, under the guise of commercial aviation.

3. Subsequent review by CINCPAC and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff indicates that Tourane would be preferable to Cap St
Jacques. Tourane's advantages outweigh its relative vulnera-
bility. Its forward position would be operationally useful.
Its improvement would require less money and time than would
Cap St Jacques. Tourane's position on the Bangkok-Hong Kong
air route lends plausibility to its development as a commer-
cial jet facility.

lh, It is recommended that Tourane be substituted for Cap
St Jacques in the International Cooperation Administration's
improvement program as the proposed second jet facility for
Vietnam.

5. It is requested that you advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff

of your position and the views of the Department of State on this
matter, i. order that CINCPAC may, in turn, be informed.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:

N. F. TWINING,
Chairman,
