-2- 538, SEPTEMBER 5, 2 PM (SECTION 2 OF 2) FROM SAIGON

WHILE THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH LIKELIHOOD AT THIS TIME OF
COUPLED BY ARMY, PICTURE IS NOT SO CLEAR RE REACTION OF ARMY TO
DEMONSTRATION ON COUP STARTED BY OTHERS. IT COULD BE CLEARLY
SHOWN THAT SUCH ACTION WAS COMMUNIST-INSPIRED NO PROBLEM RE ARMY
REACTION WOULD EXIST, BUT AS ALREADY INDICATED COMMUNISTS ARE
LIKELY TO ACT DISCREETLY BEHIND SCENES, IF ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST
DIEM, PROBABLY ADEQUATE NUMBER OF POLICE AND ARMED FORCES TO PUT

IT DOWN WOULD INITIALLY RESPOND TO CALL; IF ACTION DIRECTED AGAINST
ENTOURAGE OR REPRESENTED APPEAL FOR ACTION BY GOVERNMENT, PROBLEM
OF PUTTING IT DOWN MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT. IN EITHER CASE COURSE
OF DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS REPULSION AT ANY EXTENSIVE SHEDDING OF
BLOOD OF NON-COMMUNISTS MIGHT QUICKLY CHANGE ATTITUDE ARMY UNITS
INTO ONE UNFAVORABLE TO CONTINUATION REPRESSIVE MEASURES.

9. GENERAL. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF PROBLEM IS UNEASY POLITICAL
ATMOSPHERE ITSELF, CREATED BY COMBINATION OF CONTINUING VC
POLITICAL AND MILITARY GAINS, INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF GVN
COUNTERACTION AND SELF CORRECTION AND PANICKY TENDENCIES BY SOME
ELEMENTS TO CONSIDER DRASTIC MEASURES, EVEN A COUP. TO FORESTALL
COMMUNIST TAKEOVER. THIS LATENT EXPLOSIVE FORCE COULD BE TOUCHED
OFF BY AN ILL-ADVISED MOVE BY SINCERE OR OPPORTUNISTIC
OPPOSITIONISTS OR BY UNDULY HARSH REPRESSIVE ACTION BY THE GVN.

CONCLUSION: REAL POSSIBILITY DEMONSTRATIONS IN SAIGON EXISTS.
COULD BE INSTIGATED BY DONG-BUU FACTION, ESPECIALLY IF IT
DECIDES RISK OVERLOOKING FEAR OF COMMUNIST EXPLOITATION. COULD
ALSO BE INSTIGATED BY OPPOSITION ELEMENTS OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT, BUT
SEEMS UNLIKELY WOULD BE OF ANY SIZEABLE PROPORTIONS UNLESS

HOOKED UP WITH COMMUNIST-INFILTRATED GROUP ESPECIALLY IN LABOR
FIELD, ANY DEMONSTRATION MORE LIKELY TO BE INITIALLY LOYAL
PROTEST CALLING FOR CHANGES IN POLICIES AND PERSONAL AROUND DIEM
BUT COULD DEVELOP INTO ANTI-DIEM RIOT, WHILE INITIAL DEMONSTRATION
CAN PROBABLY BE PUT DOWN, LONGER TERM OUTCOME WOULD LIKELY DEPEND
UPON ARMY ATTITUDE AND DIEM'S METHOD ON HANDLING CRISIS. IN ANY
EVENT VC EXPLOITATION IS LIKELY.
