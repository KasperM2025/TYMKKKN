IN VIEW DEVELOPMENTS KOREA, TURKEY, RECENT COUP D'LADS, AND ATTEMPTED
ANTI-GVN DEMONSTRATION ABOUT WEEK AGO (OUR 432) WE BELIEVE IT DESIRABLE

', ASSESS POSSIBILITIES FOR DEMONSTRATION AND COUP HERE AND LIKELY OUTCOME.

POTENTIALITIES OF VARIOUS GROUPS FOR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THESE TYPES
GIVEN BELOW: .

1. PEASANTS. VARIOUS FACTORS DISCONTENT EXIST- SUCH AS LACK OF ADEQUATE
PROTECTION AGAINST COMMUNIST ATTACKS AND PRESSURES, LOW PRICES PADDY,
’ COMPULSORY LABOR ON AGROVILLES AND OTHER PROJECTS, AND ARBITRARY METHODS
OF AUTHORITIES. DIEM HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO TRY ALLEVIATE SOURCES OF
DISCONTENT (OUR G-79) BUT IT IS IMPORTANT HE TAKES OTHERS BECAUSE
PEASANTRY REPRESENT KEY TO SUCCESS OR FAILURE COMMUNIST GUERRILLA WARFARE
' IN COUNTRYSIDE AND THUS TO GRADUAL UNDERMINING OF RUGIMB, HOWEVER, ANY
SUDDEN DEMONSTRATION OR COUP AGAINST GVN LIKELY TO CENTER IN SATGON AND
SEEMS IMPROBABLE THAT PEASANTRY IN VIEW LACK ORGANIZATION, TRANSPORT
PROBLEMS, ETC. WOULD PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLE THEREIN.

2. COMMUNISTS, WHILE THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT COMMIES HAVE SOME STRENGTH
IN SAIGON. THEY HAVE NOT YET OPENLY SHOWN THEIR HAND IN CITY AND ARE MUCH
MORE LIKELY OPERATE THROUGH INFILTRATED, OSTENSIBLY NON-COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONS
WHICH THEY WILL HELP INSTIGATE TO ACTION. EVEN WITHOUT DEMONSTRATION ATTEMPT
BY OTHER GROUPS, THEY MAY ENGAGE IN HIT AND RUN TACTICS OF VIOLENCE IN SAIGON
AND IN CASE OF ANY DEMONSTRATION WOULD STEP UP SUCH TACTICS DURING CONFUSION
AND WOULD ATTEMPT BEHIND SCENES TO MANIPULATE ANY DEMONSTRATION WHICH BEGAN,

. PARTICULARLY BY TRYING PROVOKE GViT TO TAKE HARSH MEASURE IN REPRESSION.

3. LABOR. TRADE UNIONS ARE PROBABLY BEST ORGANIZED NON-MILITARY GROUP IN
VIET-DAM AND POSSESS MOTIVES FOR POLITICAL ACTION. ‘TRAN QUOC SUU, HEAD .
CViC, IS ALLIED WITH MINISTER AGRICULTURE LE VAN DONG AGAINST sHU-TUY=N FACTION
_ IN CAN LAO PARTY; EACH GROUP IS ALSO SUPPORTING COMPETING LEADERSHIP IN

OTHER MAIN LAPOR FEDERATION CSTV. DONG HAS TALKED PRIVATELY ABOUT DEMON-
STRATION. SHOULD HIS PACTION DECIDE UPON ONE, LABOR WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY

BE ITS CORE. PROBABLE FACTORS RESTRAINING DONG ARE FEAR THAT HE WOULD

NOT SUCCEED AND THAT COMMUNISTS WOULD EXPLOLT “DEMONSTRATION TO THEIR

ADVANTAGE,

LABOR ALSO HAS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL GRIEVANCES WHICH PROVIDE FERTILE GROUND
FOR OPPOSITION GROUPS OUTSIDE GOVERVMENT TO CULTIVATE. TAXI AND MOTOR
POUSSE DRIVERS FOR EXAMPLE WHO LIVE HAUD TO MOUIH EXISTENCE WERE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY INCREASE I PRICE GASOLINE. UNTIL GVil QUICKLY PERMITTED FARE RISE.
WHILE NON-GOVERUMENT OPPOSITION GROUPS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE ORGANIZ™ AS EXTRN-
