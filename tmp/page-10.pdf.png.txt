the current security situation in Vietnam. "...the

-+ yural population is generally apathetic towards the Diem

Government and there are signs of considerable dissatis-

faction and silent opposition.” Without support of the

rural population, no fingl solution can be found to the

internal security problem. Militarily, the GVN organi-

gation lacks unity of command. The situation is simmed

up.!..the government has tended to treat the population

with suspicion or to coerce it and has been rewarded

with an attitude of apathy or resentment." Seigon 278
