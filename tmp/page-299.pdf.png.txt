most critics still respect Diem as only leader at moment but
this feeling could easily change unless he takes fairly drastic
action to meet criticism and basic desires most strata population.

We believe also that unless Diem takes early effective action
on political front, coup has increased chances for development
neutralism and for anti-Americanism among those critical of GVN.
Despite our close identification with Diem and his regime
critics have not to date bracketed us with government in ex-
pressing their dissatisfaction. Many have told us however

that only we can induce Diem adopt changes which will save

his regime, thus indicating they look to us to help them. If,
after failure of clearly anti-Communist coup attempt to bring
about changes we are not successful in inducing Diem to make
peaceful changes, critics may well become frustrated, turn
against U.S., seek other means bring about change and might even
move toweard neutralist position in middle. If Viet Cong
guerrilla successes in countryside continue at rate registered
during past year, this will also increase frustration of armed
forces and population and could provide soil in which neutalism
may grow.
