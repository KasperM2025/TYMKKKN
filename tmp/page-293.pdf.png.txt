MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY DOUGLAS
From: Brig Gen Lansdale, 0SO/OSD

Subject: Vietnam

In determining U.S. policy towards Vietnam in the immediate
future, you might find the following personal observations of help:

President Ngo Diah Diem will have the 1954 coup attempt
of General Minh in mind as he deals with the leaders of the 1960
coup attempt and receives U.S. advice about punishment. In 1954,
Diem was persuaded to let Minh and his key officers leave the
country unpunished. A few weeks later, they were instigating a
revolt by the sect forces against Diem which led to considerable
bloodshed in March and April 1955. President Diem always
felt that a little more firmness with a few individuals would have.
cooled many of the hot-heads who later listed to Minh.

The 1954 and 1960 events have enough similarities to
make the 1954 lesson fresh in his mind. Both coup attempts were
in November. The military leader of each claimed inspiration
from Nasser of Egypt and had rather close ties with former chief
of state Bao Dai. Both had imprecise programs of political aims,
stated as generalized ideals which sounded as phoney as a $3-bill
to the people they hoped would rally to their cause, but which
coincided with a French analysis of the desires of the U.S.
Ambassador and his political staff. Both were certain that Army
units wouldn't act against them; both woeed the sect organizations
and the same political parties; both seem to share the same eeLengs
and acquaintances in France and Cambodia.

The actions of the U.S. Ambassador undoubtedly have
deepened President Diem's suspicions of his motivations. Diem
cannot help but wonder at U.S. objectives as voiced by such 4
