CENTRALIZED INTELLIGENCE, ETC, THIS MESSAGE THEREFORE DEALS
WIRH OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RECOMMENDATIONS, I REALIZE
SOME MEASURES I AM RECOMMENDING ARE DRASTIC AND WOULD BE MOST
IMPOLITIC FOR AN AMBASSADOR TO MAKE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
BUT CONDITIONS HERE ARE BY NO MEANS NORMAL. DIEM GOVERNMENT
IS IN QUITE SERIOUS DANGER. THEREFORE, IN MY OPINION PROMPT
AND EVEN DRASTIC ACTION IS CALLED FOR. I AM WELL AWARE THAT
DIEM HAS IN PAST DEMONSTRATED ASTUTE JUDGMENT AND HAS SURVIVED
OTHER SERIOUS CRISES. POSSIBLY HIS JUDGMENT WILL PROVE SUPERIOR
TO OURS THIS TIME, BUT I BELIEVE NEVERTHELESS WE HAVE NO AL-
TERNATIVE BUT TO GIVE HIM OUR BEST JUDGMENT OF WHAT WE BELIEVE
IS REQUIRED TO PRESERVE HIS GOVERNMENT. WHILE DIEM OBVIOUSLY
RESENTED MY FRANK TALKS EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WILL PROBABLY
RESENT EVEN MORE SUGGESTIONS OUTLINED BELOW, HE HAS APPARENTLY
ACTED ON SOME OF OUR EARLIER SUGGESTIONS AND MIGHT ACT ON AT
LEAST SOME OF THE FOLLOWING:

1. I WOULD PROPOSE HAVE FRANK AND FRIENDLY TALK WITH DIEM AND
EXPLATN OUR SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT PRESENT SITUATION AND HIS
POLITICAL POSITION. I WOULD TELL HIM THAT, WHILE MATTERS I
AM RATSING DEAL PRIMARILY WITH INTERNAL AFFATRS, I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO HIM FRANKLY AND TRY TO BE AS HELPFUL AS I CAN BY
GIVING HIM THE CONSIDERED JUDGMENT OF MYSELF AND SOME OF HIS
FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON ON APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ASSIST HIM
IN PRESENT SERIOUS SITUATION. (BELIEVE IT BEST NOT INDICATE
TALKING UNDER INSTRUCTIONS.) I WOULD PARTICULARLY STRESS
DESIRABILITY OF ACTIONS TO BROADEN AND INCREASE HIS POPULAR
SUPPORT PRIOR TO 1961 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS REQUIRED BY
CONSTITUTION BEFORE END APRIL. I WOULD PROPOSE FOLLOWING AC-
TIONS TO PRESIDENT:

2. PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK EFFECT IS REQUIRED TO TAKE INITIATIVE
FROM COMMUNIST PROPAGANDISTS AS WELL AS NON-COMMUNIST OPPO-
SITIONISTS AND CONVINCE POPULATION GOVERNMENT TAKING EFFECTIVE
_ MEASURES TO DEAL WITH PRESENT SITUATION, OTHERWISE WE FEAR

MATTERS COULD GET OUT OF HAND. TO ACHIEVE THAT EFFECT FOLLOW-
ING SUGGESTED:

(A) BECAUSE OF
