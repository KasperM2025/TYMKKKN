With Chinese assistance, the
DRV has also made rapid proeress in rehabili-
tating North Vietuam’s highway system. A
bridge building program for 1956 is aimed at
eliminating most of the ferries on primary
roads. Rehabilitation of the Hanoi-Lai Chau
route and of roads south from Hanoi toward
the 17th parallel will facilitate the movement
of troops and supplies to any point along the
borders of Laos and South Victnam. Soviet
assistance is making possible the improvement
of port facilities at Haiphong which will fur-
ther expedite the distribution of Bloc min
tar y and economic supplies.

18. The chronic deficit in the balance of pay-

ments position of the North Vietnam area has

been deepened by the failure to restore agri-
cultural and industrial production and by the
abnormal requirements for foreign goods and

. -technical aid. The foreign exchange position

has also been worsened by the break in com-
plementary trade relations with the south.
A measure of the deficit and of the critical
economic situation is suggested by the magni-
tude of Bloc grants tothe DRV. In July 1935,
Communist China granted the sum of 800,-
000,000 yuan (about $530,000,000 at official
rates) and the USSR promised 400,000,000
rubles ($100,000,609 at official rates). Smaller

grants have been extended by several of the
European Satellites. A substantial portion of
the aid received has been in the form of con-
sumer poods.

19. We believe that during the pericd of this
estimate the DRV will continue to concen-
trate, with moderate success, on efforts to
increase agricultural, mineral, and light in-
dustry production. The DRV has the re-
sources to increase exports and to support
a modest industrial development. However,
at least for several years, it will require sub-
Stantial Bloc assistance to support even a
minimum standard of living and there ap-
pears little prospect for substantial forced
saying to support rapid industrialization in
the near future.

DRV Military Sirengih

20. The “Vietnam People’s Army” (VPA)
now has a total streneth of about 266,000 men
organized in 16 infantry divisions, 2 artil-
lery divisions, 1 AAA groupment, 10 separate
infantry regiments, and 5 border and coast-
al security regiments. As the VPA continues
_its evolution toward a modern force, several
more divisions may be organized using exist-
ing separate regiments. Althougn further
substantial increases in the numerical
strength of the army appear unlikely, a ready
pool of semitrained manpower exists among
the 117,000 men now in regional and popular
troop units. The recent announcement by
the DRV of a troop reduction probably re-
fiects the releases of unfit personnel since the
Armistice.

‘21. More extensive training was probably
made possible by reduced commitments. to
internal security missions and reconstruction
projects, and multidivisional maneuvers were
reported in late 1955. We believe that about
half of the major combat units are combat-
ready and the remainder probably will reach
that status during 1956. Even at its present
level of training, the VPA is capable of de-
feating the total military forces of Sou ua Viet-

nam, Cambodia, and Laos. :

dispositions of VPA units during the past
