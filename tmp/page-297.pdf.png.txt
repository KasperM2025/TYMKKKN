Some three weeks after coup, following are my evaluation and
recommendations:

On surface life has returned to normal, Viet Cong activities
appear to have diminished somewhat, although this could be

lull before storm; Diem has not adopted vengeful attitude
against rebels, although certain others have sought take
advantage of situation for "settlement of accounts" and some
of "people's" actions against rebels' families, newspapers,

et cetera, were unfortunate; Diem has taken some steps recom-
mended by us in military field, i.e., partially placed Civil
Guard under defense (this being clarified); is reportedly working
on plan to set up what we hope will be effective operations
commands, including reorganization and streamlining of field
headquarters which we hope will be allowed to operate through
firm chain-of-command, Diem, Nhu and Thuan have told us they
working on other reforms, i.e. election youth representatives
to village councils, eventual implementation elective representa-
tives to National Economie Council, plan for periodic "fireside
chats," promised reorganization of the cabinet structure, and
other unspecified moves which Thuan promised would be worked
out by Christmas. It is hoped that these reforms are not just
reforms on surface with little or no substance. Despite these
signs, there is basically quite serious under-current maiaise
and skepticism whether effective reforms will be taken soon
enough. This uneasy feeling not confined to intellectuals or
opposition groups; but to sizeable number of others, i.e.,

cabinet
