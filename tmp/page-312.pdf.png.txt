DISCUSSION, HE WAS BASICALLY NEGATIVE. DIEM DID NOT REPLY
TO MY REMARKS -IMMEDIATELY BUT INSISTED ESSENTIAL HAVE ADDI-
TIONAL 20,000 TROOPS SINCE WOULD DO NO GOOD TO TRY TO PUT IN
REFORMS, BUILD FACTORIES, ROADS AND BRIDGES, ETC., UNLESS
THESE THINGS AND PEOPLE COULD BE PROTECTED, HE REFERRED
SEVERAL TIMES TO THE NEED FOR 20,000 MEN STRESSING NEED
BECAUSE OF DETERIORATING LAO SITUATION, I THEN REMARKED WE
HAD JUST LEARNED THAT HE HAD INCREASED FORCE LEVEL OF CIVIL
GUARD TO 64;000 AND ASKED IF THIS INCREASE WOULD NOT FILL
SECURITY FORCE NEEDS. DIEM REPLIED CIVIL GUARD NOT TRAINED
SO NEEDS BRING BACK 20,000 RESERVISTS.. HE ASKED THAT I URGE
DEPT TO GIVE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION FORCE LEVEL REQUEST AND
I REITERATED MATTER UNDER CAREFUL STUDY IN WASHINGTON.

REFERRING TO MY REMARKS HE AGAIN ATTACKED THE VICIOUSNESS OF
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS, PARTICULARLY THE FRENCH, WHO ONLY SEEK
SENSATIONAL NEWS. HE THEN REVIEWED IN SOME DETATL ECONOMIC
AND SOCIAL PROGRESS MADE IN VIET-NAM IN THE PAST SIX YEARS
WHICH HAVE RAISED STANDARD OF LIVING HERE ABOVE MOST SEA COUN-
TRIES AND ASKED WHY CORRESPONDENTS DIDN'T REPORT THIS INSTEAD
OF PICKING UP RADIO HANOI REPORTS SPREAD BY DISGRUNTLED
VIETNAMESE INTELLECTUALS. AS I HAD DONE IN MY REMARKS, I
REITERATED IF HE AND OTHER MINISTERS HAD PERIODIC PRESS
CONFERENCES AND IF MINISTERS WOULD HAVE FRANK TALKS WITH
CORRESPONDENTS THEY WOULD WRITE MORE OBJECTIVE STORIES.

REFERRING OUR SUGGESTION ALLOW ASSEMBLY TO CARRY ON INVESTI-
GATIONS, DIEM POINTEDLY STATED THAT SINCE UNDER THE CONSTITU-
TION THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATURE ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE,
AND IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR THE ASSEMBLY TO INVESTIGATE
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS, I REPLIED WE HAD THE SAME SYSTEM AND,
AS HE KNEW, CONGRESS DOES INVESTIGATE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS
AND MAKES FINDINGS PUBLIC AND POINTED OUT THIS WOULD BE VERY
HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT HERE IN ORDER TO QUELL UNFOUNDED RUMORS,
DIEM OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T AGREE. DIEM SPENT SOME TIME DENOUNCING
RICH INTELLECTUALS AND BUSINESSMEN.WHO DO NOT PAY THEIR TAXES
AND THEN BLAME THE GOVERNMENT FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH FOR THE
