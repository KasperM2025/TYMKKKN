CALCULATED-RISK BASIS IN ORDER TO CREATE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK WHICH IT
BELIEVED ESSENTIAL AT THIS TIME. PRESIDENT MADE NO FURTHER COM€NT
EXCEPT TO TELL ME THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER THE SUGGESTIONS I HAD GIVEN HIH,
I THEN AGAIN BEGGED HIS INDULGENCE AND ASKED IF I COULD BRING UP A MOST
SENSITIVE AND DELICATE MATTER WHICH I FELT IN HIS INTEREST AND Iv

. INTEREST OF VIETNAM I SHOULD DISCUSS VERY FRANKLY. FROM NOTES IN

FRENCH WHICH I READ PUT DID NOT LEAVE WITH HIM, (COPY BY POUCH), I
DISCUSSED GROWING CRITICISM OF HIS PROTHER AND MADAM NHU, AS WELL AS DR.
BUYEN AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE ASSIGNED ABROAD. DIEM DID NOT
INTERRUPT MB BUT ASSUMED SOMMWHAT GRIM, AND I DETECT#D SLIGHTLY HURT
MANNER.. HIS ONLY COMMENT WAS THAT THESE RUMORS ABOUL THE NHUS WERE
SPREAD BY COMMUNISTS. I REPLIED THAT I WAS SURE THAT COMMUNISTS WERE
DOING ALL THEY COULD TO SPREAD SUCH RUMORS BUT I REPEATED THAT THE
UNFORTUNATE PART ABOUT IT IS THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE BELIEVING
THESE REPORTS--VIETHAMESE LOYAL TO HIM, THOSE WHO MIGHT BE CONSIDERED
IN THE OPPOSITION, FOREIGH CIVILIANS AND FOREIGN DIPLOMATS TO SAY
NOTHING FO THE PRESS. I REPEATED, AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY, THESE REPORTS
WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGING PRESTIGE OF HIS REGIME,

AFTER DISCUSSING THE NHUS, I AGAIN APOLOGIZED, FIRST OF ALL FOR BRINGING
UP THIS PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE SUBJECT, AS WELL, AS THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS
I HAD MADE. I AGAIN ASKED HIS INDULCE: ICE AND FORGIVEDESS FOR SPEAKING

- SO FRANKLY AND ADDED I HOPED HE WOULD UNDERSTAND bs I WAS TALKING AS

.

A SINCERE FRIEND.

COMMENT: CONSIDERING THE FAIRLY FRANK CRITICISM I MADE OF HIS REGIME AND
FAMILY, DIE OUTWARDLY SHOWED NO REAL RESENTMENT. APTER I APOLOGIZED
FOR BRINGIVG UP THE NWHU QUESTION, DIE? REMAINED STUENT FOR A BIT AND THEY
WE DISCUSSED LAO DEVELOPMENTS IN A MATTER-OF-FACT REALISTIC WAY. T

“SAID I WAS SURE. THAT PARSONS WOULD-FILL HIM IN REGARDING LATEST LAO

DEVELOPMETS WHEN HE IS HERS ON 18TH. I THEN REITERATED MY CLOSING
APOLOGETI«: COMMENTS ON THE NEU QUESTIOI AND TOOK MY LEAVE, WHICH WAS QUITE
CORDIAL. 3 :
