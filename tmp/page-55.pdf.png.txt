Subject: U.S. Force Commitments to the SEATO

1. Reference is made to ADMIN CINCPAC Message O10151Z July
1956, subject: "Preliminary Summary of SEATO Third Military
Staff Planners' Conference, Singapore, 11-27 June," which stated,
inter alia, that CINCPAC would require high level policy guidance
on the matter of U.S. force commitments to the SEATO.

requirements planning progresses toward detailed plans, there will
pe increasing pressure placed on the United States, particularly
by the Asian members of SEATO, for information as to availability
of U.S. forces to support SHATO plans.

3. The United States should not.duplicate the pattern of NATO
and its significant standing military forces by earmarking U. 5.
forces for Southeast Asia. Instead, the United States should
maintain mobile striking power readily available for immediate
operations and sufficient, in concept with other nations, to
defeat overt Communist local aggression in the SEATO area. The
Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that although detailed U.S. stra-

of the SEATO nations, the United States should discuss her capa~-
bilities and methods of providing support to these nations without
making a specific commitment of forces. The major effort of the
United States should be to provide those types of forces which
are needed in the SEATO area and logistic support to indigenous
forces.

h, The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the. United States
make no specific force commitments to the SEATO but that the U. S.
