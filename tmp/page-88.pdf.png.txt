CAMBODIA (Revision of pars. 39-42 of NSC 5809.)

39. Seek to increase Cmabodia's respect for and confidence in the
United States and the Free World in order to assist in maintaining
Canbodia's independence and in curbing its tendency to increased
orientation toward the Sino-Soviet Bloc. To this end demonstrate
continued friendly U. S. support for Cambodia's independence, understanding
of its policy of neutrality and concern for its economic and social pro-
' gress.

ho. In shaping particular courses of action in Cambodia, take into
account the fact that Prince Sihanouk enjoys widespread popularity,
particularly among the rural population, and controls all major sources
of political power. Devote special efforts toward developing Sihanouk's
understanding of U. S&S. policies and of the U. 8S. position in Southeast
Asia, bearing in mind his extreme sensitivity to any suggestion of
pressure or slight.

hi. Since real or fancied threats from neighboring Free World
countries have been a major factor contributing to Cambodia's sense of
insecurity an? its consequent mean iess to accept Sino-Soviet Bloc
support, endeavor persistently and firmly to improve Cambodia's relations
with these countries, particularly Thailand and Viet Nam. Take every
appropriate occasion to impress on the governments of neighboring

countries the importance of repairing their relations with Cambodia
