But today, in facing decisions whether to make a
further major increase in the US performance and whether
to maintain at a high level that portion of the war that
is really wholly US--bombing--we must at least ask our-
selves whether we are not at or beyond another kind of
"cross-over point", where we are putting in an undue pro-
portion of US effort in relation to the essential fact
that in the last analysis the South Vietnamese have got
to do the job themselves. By "do the job themselves" we
mean concretely a much more effective South Vietnamese
role in security, pacification, and solid government while
the war is going on. But we mean also the progressive
development of a South Viet-Nam that can stand on its
own feet whenever North Viet-Nam calls it off, and can nail
down at that point what could otherwise be a temporary and
illusory "victory" which, if it unraveled, would make our
whole effort look ridiculous, undermine the gains in confi-
dence that have been achieved in Southeast Asia and else-
where, and have the most disastrous effects on our own
American resolve to bear burdens in Asia and indeed through-
out the world. 29/

Turning to the specific question of the 200,000 man force increase
Bundy argued that the gains from such a major force increase were increas-
ingly marginal while the effect on the South Vietnamese, a very much more
important factor and one which went to the heart of the conflict itself
and our ability to achieve a lasting peace, may not be so marginal:

Obviously, the assessment of the effect of our actions
on the South Vietnamese is an extremely difficult one. It
may be that the "cross-over point" was reached in late 1965,
when it became clear that we were conducting a massive inter-
vention; perhaps any further change from additional forces,
on any scale, is at most one of slight degree. Certainly
we have all felt that our force increases up to their present
strength were absolutely required in order to bring about a
condition even more essential than maintaining South Viet-
namese performance--the blunting and reversing of the North
Vietnamese effort that, in 1965, was about to take over the
country. But the question now presents itself in a new form,
when 200,000 more men do not make the difference between
victory and defeat, but at most the difference between vic-
tory in three years and victory in 5, on what is necessarily
a calculation assuming both South Vietnamese and North Viet-
namese performance and morale as relative constants. And,
on the other side of the coin, we have reached a point where
the South Vietnamese have managed in part to pull themselves
together and must learn to do so more. Hence, the gains from
