General Westmoreland had already made his 44-battalion
request and warned of disaster if they were not forth-
coming. May's report begins to show the change in mood,.
but its ambiguous evaluation is in sharp contrast to the
brief backward look offered in September.

Pacification is mentioned in the January evaluation, but
fades away to virtually nothing in the months of the build-

up.

The evaluations do not suggest that the main force threat
is in any way diminishing by the end of 1965. Indeed, they
accurately predict larger battles in 1966. They do not
suggest, therefore, that the time had come to start em-
phasizing pacification at the expense of exerting more
ressure directly on the enemy. The evaluations do not
address this question directly, of course, but they do
suggest that if any greater emphasis was to be put on
pacification, it could be done only if there was not a
corresponding reduction in the attack effort against the
vc. This, in turn, would imply that if pacification was
to receive greater emphasis at the beginning of 1966, it
would require either more Allied troops or else might
lead to a lessening of pressure on the VC.
