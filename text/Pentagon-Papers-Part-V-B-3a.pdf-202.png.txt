Communist China has been and now is training,
equipping and supplying the Communist forces in Indo-
china. There is the risk that, as in Korea, Red China
might sehd its owh army into Indochina. The Chinese
Communist regime should realize that such a second
aggression could not occur without grave consequences
which might not be confined. to Indochina. I say this
soberly in the interest of peace and in the hope of pre-
venting another aggressor miscalculation.

We want peace in Indochina, as well as in Korea.
The political conference about to be held relates in the
first instance to Korea. But growing out of that
conference could come, if Red China wants it, an end
of aggression and restoration of peace in Indochina. The
United States would welcome such a development.
