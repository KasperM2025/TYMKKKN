The increases in advisory strength which reflected the NSAM LLL
decisions were authorized in December 1961 and January 1962. By the
end of 1961 MAAG's authorized strength had been more than doubled, to
2067. â€˜This number was increased again in January to more than 3000.
Included in these increases were the new dimensions of U.S. advice:
pattalion advisors, province advisors, and an additionel 500 Special
Forces advisors (making a new total of 805 in the Special Forces program
under CIA control). 80/

It has elready been noted that Secretary McNamara gave forceful
impetus to manning these newly created positions in the shortest possible
time. They were, indeed, filled quickly. By April 1962 the total number
of Army field advisory personnel in RVN exceeded the authorized number.

By this time, too, the authorized total for all services had been stabilized

at about 3400. This total was reduced in November to 3150, then remained
essentially constant until a new round of increases Was inaugurated in
mid-196),. 81/ Thus, the build-up associated with the Taylor mission
consisted of a fourfold increase in U.S. advisory presence (a mach larger
increase if one counts U.S. support units). After the build-up was
completed, in the spring of 1962, the number of advisors remained stable
until many months after the fall of the Diem government.

While the total number of advisors remained fairly constant, however,
shifts occurred in the distribution of advisory personnel. From the
completion of the build-up, for instance, until the coup which overthrew
Diem, the number of field advisors at corps and division level increased
severalfold and the number of province advisors doubled while other field
advisory strengths remained about the same. These developments are shown
in detail in the tabuler summary at the end of this study and summarized
in the following table:
