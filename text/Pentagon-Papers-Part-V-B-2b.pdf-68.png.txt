major non-Communist base areas in this quarter of the world--
Japan, India, and Australia--depends in a large measure on
the denial of Southeast Asia to the Communists, If Southeast
Asia is lost, these three base areas will Seas to -be isolated
from one another; ; 2 ;

ay The fall of Indochina would undoubtedly lead to the
fall Of tho othor mainland states of Southoast Asia, Thoir
fall would:

(1) Require changing the Philippines and Indonesia
from supporting positions in the Asian offshore island

in NSC’ 64,

now actively opposing communism in Southeast Asia, Small indigenous
