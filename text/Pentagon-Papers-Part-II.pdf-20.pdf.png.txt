René Pleven, Minister of National Defense, declared that: 1Y/

government in an affair of this gravity. It is necessary
that, on the international level, the vote that takes place
tonight reveals truly the-major importance that this event
should have in the eyes of the entire world."

Union before international Communism. But since the arrival
of the Chinese Communists on the frontier of Tonkin, Indo-
china has become the frontier of Western civilization and
the war in Indochina is integrated into the cold war."
Premier Georges Bidault was the last speaker:

ratification of the independence of Vietnam was announced.
The U.S. assessment of the situation, and its action, is
