7- Southerners Regrouped North

Whether or not at the time of Geneva the DRV leaders
genuinely expected the plebescite of 1956, the Viet Minh of Annam
and Cochinchina were apparently instructed through their Communist
Party cadre that elections would be held. Thousands of Vietnamese
left the South under the regroupment provisions of the Settlement.
Upon cadre assurances of return, they staked family ties, ancestral
lands, and fortunes.

Unfortunately, we know little still about the Southern
regroupees in the North, and less about the Viet Minh who stayed behind
when their comrades departed. The reports of the International Com-
mission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam record the movement of
only 4,269 civilians fron the South to north of the 17th parallel. 69/
After April 1955, as reported by the ICC, refugees applied to the
Saigon authorities, in such numbers that the GVN proved unable to meet
demands for permits or transportation. Demonstrations occurred, and
special arrangements by the ICC and the French were necessitated. None-
theless, the total number thus formally involved in ICC reported moves
was less than 5,000. 70/ The very sizable migration in 1954 of Viet
Minh from the French controlled zone aboard Polish and Soviet ships to
the North has not been reported authoritatively. An estimated 90,000
armed Viet Minh departed. An Indian member of the ICC published in
1964 the following figures, which correspond with the totals furnished
by the French and the Poles, and which appear on present evidence to
be as reliable as any: T/

Among the total, there were a significant number of Montagnards --
Bernard Fall states 10,000 -- and children. A Viet Cong lieutenant
colonel, captured in 1961, then one of the senior officers of the Viet
Cong intelligence services, has confirmed that Highlanders and 10,000
children were among the regroupees, and that DRV was taking pains to
educate both groups well.
