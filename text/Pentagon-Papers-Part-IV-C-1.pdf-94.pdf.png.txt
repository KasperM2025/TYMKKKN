Recommendations 8, 9, and 10 were accomplished rather simply and ex-
peditiously because they consisted entirely of supplying the South Viet-
namese materials that they needed. It did not involve our inducing the
Vietnamese themselves to do anything. Recommandation 8 was to provide the
Vietnamese Air Force 25 AlH aircraft in exchange for present T-28's. Recom-
mendation 9 was to provide the Vietnamese army additional M-113 APC's (with-
drawing the M-114's there), additional riverboats and approximately $5-10
million worth of additional materiel. Recommendation 10 was to announce
publicly the fertilizer program and to expand it with a view to trebling
within two years the amount of fertilizer currently made available.

MAP funding for Recommendation 8 was approved by ISA on 25 March 196)
following approval of the delivery schedule on 22 March. On 1 May 1964,
19 AlH's were delivered and six more scheduled for delivery 10 days later.
A Navy unit of 4 support officers, 8 instruction pilots and 150 men arrived
on 30 April 196. to train Vietnamese crews until they could assume full
responsibility, which was estimated to be in three to six months. By early
May planning and funding action for the provision of the M-113's had been
completed, According to the schedule developed in response to the request
for this materiel made by CINCPAC and COMUSMACV, 17 M-113's were shipped
to arrive in Saigon 17 April, 16 were due to arrive 29 April, 30 were shipped
to arrive by 1 Jume, and 30 more were to arrive by 10 July. There was an
agreement between CINCPAC and COMUSMACV that no additional howitzers, river-
boats or AN/PRC/41s were to be recommended at that time. Eighty-five
thousand tons of fertilizer had been requested and procured by early May
for spring planting, and this had been publicized by the GVN and in Washing-

. ton. A distribution scheme was being developed and refined in early May

with provision for further expansion including a probable 18,000 tons re-
quirement in the fall. 79/

There were two important visitations to Saigon during April. The first
was by General Earle G. Wheeler, then Chief of Staff, USA, who visited
Saigon from 15-20 April and represented Secretary McNamara and the JCS during
the visit of the Secretary of State to Saigon 17-20 April. It was during
these meetings that Khanh's desire to shift the emphasis of the struggle to
an attack on the North first became emphatically evident. In the meeting
with Khanh on 16 April, Wheeler, in company with General Harkins, was in-
formed by Khanh that eventually the war must be moved north. Harkins later
told Wheeler that this was the first time Khanh had ever said that extending
operations to the North was inevitable. Khanh explained that when the move .-
to the North oceurred MACV would have to take over all the logistics. He
further said he was ready to start planning for an extension of operations
to the North.
