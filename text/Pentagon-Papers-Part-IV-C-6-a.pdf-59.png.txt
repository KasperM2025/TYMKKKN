in local RVN military commanders utilizing the security forces
(primarily RÂ¥, PF) in offensive actions against hard core VC
units. The introduction of US/FWMA forces into key areas has
reestablished the balance of force in these areas in favor of
the GVN. These deployments allow RVNAF forces to be employed
in the roles for which they were originally conceived and

role. 47

The CINCPAC/MACV submission included the following estimates of
MACV's requirements and the deployments to Vietnam possible under the
assumptions of Cases 1, 2, and 3.

Strength at End of cy '66

Maneuver Buns Requirement Case 1 Case 2 Case 3
U.S. 79 79 TOX 61
Allied 23 P23 23 23
Total = 368 102 . 98

Equivalent Strength 102 96 88 72
Personnel

U.S. 459,000 422,517

* Other 9 battalions available in Jan 67 48/

The difference in the programs in Case 1 and Case 2 was the degree
to which helicopter and combat service support could be provided. The
support required for the 102 battalion force would not be completely
provided in either case, which would result according to MACV estimates
in a reduction in the effectiveness of the 102 battalion force to the
equivalent of 96 fully supported battalions under Case 1 and to the
equivalent of 88 under Case 2.

Case 3 provided a total of only 84 maneuver battalions.
J The CINCPAC requirements also included 20 battalions for reconsti-
tution of the PACOM reserve. Case 1 provided for the full 20 battalions,

Case 2 for 10, and Case 3 for 13 battalions.

CINCPAC's evaluation of the impact of the three cases upon military
objectives was:

(1) Case 3:

(a) Provides for the security of the US/FUMAF command
at the projected rate of vc/PAVN build up.
