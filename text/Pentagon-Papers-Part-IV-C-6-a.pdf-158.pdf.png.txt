In a sense, JCSM-672-66 appears to be a delaying device used to buy
time for the COMUSMACV reclamas to the DPM. However, it concomitantly
provided an excellent opening through which to drive home their views
on the bombing and negotiations.

Ibid. For McNamera's views on the communications aspects of our force
structure in SVN, see page 5, Memo for the President, 14 Oct 66.

Ibid., At another time Westmoreland reported that the President had
asked him his views in front of Thieu and Ky and he had given them;
that Rostow had asked him to put them into 4 memo which he was
drafting. McNaughton observed that he had a sort of paired list of
favorable targets -- ones related to air defense, ones to infiltra-
tion and ones to "bargaining," but none very explicitly analyzed.

The New York Times, 1 November 1966. The article said the Army had
76,451 men more than authorized, the Air Force 4313, the Navy
12,029, and the Marines over 2,000. The conclusion was that with
the increased forces (the Army had been told to go to 1,500,000
according to the piece) the country could support 500,000 troops in
SVN in CY 1967 and to these increases 600,000 the following year.

It did indicate that resistance from both civilian and military
sources was growing in the Pentagon.

Ibid. The ambiguity in the statement is interesting. The JCS ack-
nowledge that the program as proposed was adequate (even in light of
their earlier analysis of US worldwide posture deficiencies), but
could not be developed without some yet unnamed "modifications" to
the criteria. The door remained open to come back in for the reserves
if need be.
