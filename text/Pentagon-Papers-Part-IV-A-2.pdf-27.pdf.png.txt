commitment to the Korean war. In a somewhat premature judgment of out-
comes, a progress report on the implementation of NSC 64 (March 15, 1951):
stated that "American military aid furnished the States' forces and the
Army of the French Union may have been the decisive factor in the preserva-
tion of the area against Communist aggression." 45/ Through 1952 and into
1954 the MDAP shipments to Indochina increased steadily 46/: by February 3,
1953, the United States had shipped 137,200 long tons of material (224
ships' cargoes); by July 1954, approximately 150,000 long tons had been
sent, including 1,800 combat vehicles, 30,887 motor transport vehicles,
361,522 small arms and machine guns, 438 naval craft, 2 World War II air-
eraft carriers, and about 500 aircraft. By the conclusion of the Geneva
agreements in July, 1954, the U.S. had delivered aid to Indochina at an
original cost of $2,600 million. 47/ Nonetheless, protests of the French
at the slowness of deliveries and the "interference" of MAAG with French
requests were recurrent, and peaked, during the crisis days of 1954. Yet
these complaints probably reflected less genuine U.S. shortcomings than
French resentment of American efforts to advise, screen, inspect, and
verify, and sheer frustration. Moreover, the vagaries of the French logistic
system not only made the MAAG job more difficult, but further impeded com-
bat supplies.

b. Effectiveness

In spite of the conditions under which U.S. assistance to
France and the Associated States was given, the MAAG during the period of
the Indochina war was little more than a small (70 in 1950, 342 in 195k)
supply-support group which exerted far more influence upon U.S. decisions
than on the French. The French, never eager for American advice, not
only succeeded in limiting the function of MAAG to order-taking in the
commercial sense, but in fact -- through adroit pressuring of officials
above the MAAG -- sometimes reduced MAAG to the position of taking their
military orders, Available data do not permit detailed evaluation of the
efficiency of MAP, but it seems clear that French restrictions on the U.S.
MAAG reduced it to virtual impotence. }48/

However, to relate any judgment of the effectiveness of the
United States assistance program simply and directly to the outcome of the
war would clearly be inappropriate. For the most part, U.S. expectations
were not high. In the words of the American Ambassador to France in Febru-
ary, 1950, â€œobviously any program of external assistance was marginal in
character and entirely dependent for its success upon the solidity of the
base -- in this case, the firmness of French policy and actions in Indo-
china." hg/ French determination to resist American advice was not matched
by firmness in proceeding with granting independence to Vietnam, or other-
wise meeting the political situation in Indochina. Hence, as the U.S.
apparently expected, a favorable outcome to the Indochina war continued
to elude France, even with American material and financial help. U.S.
assistance enabled France to wage a military battle while it lost its
political war -- in Saigon and in Paris. (The military defeat at Dien
Bien Phu was important primarily from the point of view of its psychologi-
cal and political impact on the French, and was so interpreted in the rele-
vant U.S. intelligence estimates.) 50/
