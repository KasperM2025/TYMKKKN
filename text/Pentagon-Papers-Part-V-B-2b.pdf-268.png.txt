After the customary amenities, the Secretary proceeded to give
response to the British memorandum of March 15th, point by point, as
outlined in Mr. Allison's guidance memorandum of March 25th, After he
had finished the Ambassador expressed his thanks and asked if he might
summarize the Secretary's presentation in order to check, He did so as
follows: ,

"We do not believe that the British coricern regarding French inten-
tions in Indochina is justified and cite Mr, Ietourneau's comments made —
at his press conference March 12th to substantiate our point of view,

We have no evidence that any of the rumors cited in the British memoran-
dum as indications of French intention to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh or
withdraw from Indochina are true, We would be gratified to have proof

of any or of all of them, If it were obtained we would consider it
necessary to reconsider our policy concerning the French and Indochina
generally, We believe that the French will stay in Indochina providing
they have: (a) assurances of continued US military aid, (b) sufficient
financial aid to assist them with that portion of their budgetary deficit |
attributable to tho Indochina operation and, (c) reason to expect thot

a solution can be found to ‘their manpower problem, It is suggested thet
this solution lies in the formation of national armies, We do not

believe that the French are negoticting with Ho Chi Minh if only for the
reason that Ho does not choose to negotiate and could not even if he wishec
to do so, We do not believe that the French are planning a withdrawal

if only for the reason that such an operation could not be accomplished
successfully without the assistance of the British and oursolves, Wo
