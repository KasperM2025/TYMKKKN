Hanoi attacks hit civilian

l8-hour truce

New Year's truce

The President approved only
the modest McNamara, force
increases and ordered a stabil-
ization of the air war.

McNamara describes for the
President the failure of the
bombing to reduce infiltration
below the essential minimum
to sustain current levels of
combat in SVN. He argues for
the barrier as an alternative.

The Chiefs once again oppose
holiday standdowns for Christ-
mas, New Year's and Tet citing
the massive advantage of them
taken by the DRV during the
37-day pause.

A series of air attacks on
targets in Hanoi in early Dec.
culminated in heavy strikes

on Dec. 13-14. In the immedi-
ate aftermath, the DRV and

other communist countries claimed
extensive damage in civilian
areas. The attacks came at a
time when contacts with the DRV
through the Poles apparently had
appeared promising.

In response to the worldwide
criticism for the attacks on
civilian areas, a 10-n.m. pro-
hibited area around Hanoi was
established with a similar zone
for Haiphong. Henceforth attacks
within it could only be by speci-
fic Presidential authori zation.

A 48-hour truce and bombing pause
is observed.

A second 48-hour truce is
observed. Heavy communist
resupply efforts are observed
during the standdown. Â©
