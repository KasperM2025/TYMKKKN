McNamara's resignation leaks
to the press.

The Paul Doumer islend highway
bridge in Hanoi is struck again.

The two secretaries reach agree-
ment on ten of the 24 new
targets proposed by the Chiefs
in late Nov.

IDA's JASON Division again
produces a study of the bomb-
ing that emphatically rejects
it as a tool of policy.

Noting that the SEACABIN study
did not necessarily reflect
JCS views, the Chiefs advise
against any bombing halt.

The Pope calls on both sides
to show restraint and on the
US to halt the bombing in an
effort to start negotiations.
The President visits him the
next day to reject the idea.

A 24-hour Christmas truce is _
observed.

Another 2-hour truce.

CINCPAC's year end wrapup
asserts RT was successful
because of materiel destroyed,
and manpower diverted to mili-
tary tasks.

Westmoreland describes the
bombing as "indispensable" in
cutting the flow of supplies
and sustaining his men's morale.

Bombing is completely pro-

hibited again within 5 n.m. of
Hanoi and Haiphong, apparently
related to a diplomatic effort.
