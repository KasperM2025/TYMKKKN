C. The introduction into the area of a US com-
bat force of 25,000 to 410,000 to engage with South
Vietnamese forces in ground, air, and naval opera-
tions against the Viet Cong; and

D. An announcement by the US of its determina-
tion to hold South Vietnam and a warning, either
private or public, that North Vietnamese support of
the Viet Cong must cease or the US would launch air
attacks against North Vietnam. This action would
be taken in conjunction with Course A, B, or C. 1y/

These proposed courses of action correspond to those outlined for
consideration by the Taylor Mission, with the exception that the flood
task force proposed by Taylor has been substituted for the former
"intermediate" solution of stationing a token U.S. force at DaNang,
and that an opinion is asked on the prospects of threats to bomb the
north, again reflecting the Taylor Mission Report. *

The gist of the SNIE was that North Vietnamese would respond to an
increased U.S. commitment with an offsetting increase in infiltrated
support for the Viet Cong. Thus, the main difference in the estimated
commmist reaction to Courses A, B, and C was that each would be
stronger than its predecessor. On the prospects for bombing the north,
the SNIE implies that threats to bomb would not cause Hanoi to stop its
support for the Viet Cong, and that actual attacks on the North would
bring a strong response from Moscow and Peiping, who would "regard the
defense of North Vietnam against such an attack as imperative." 15/
