The U.S, does not want to be associated with a settlement
which falls short of the seven-point memorandum on which
Britain agreed and now appear to be less than firm. "If
either or both the French and Communists are operating

on the assumption we will adhere to any settlement they
agree to, then we may be headed for serious trouble."

Parlilies “52 to) Paris, 3 Tully LOSWS vwesuts ccsaelvccwsiae ence esis sere

Dillon recommends that if the U.S. attempts to get the

best possible settlement, we should (1) maintain a

Geneva delegation, (2) have Dulles return to head the
delegation, (3) offer French support to sell a settlement

to Vietnam if it is satisfactory, and (4) pressure Britain
to stick to the seven points of US-UK agreement. Paris 41

The French welcome the US-UK 7-point agreement except

that clarification was suggested on the conflict be-

tween provisions for elections and the position that

no political provisions should risk loss of the area

to communism, The French felt that the elections could

"go wrong." Paris 50 to Dulles, 6 July 1954.....sessesceses

The French indicate they attach no great military im-
portance to retention of Haiphong and that they were
"avoiding contact" with the Vietnamese in order not
to have to answer their questions. SECTO 560, 6 July

Mendes-France will announce to the National Assembly

that if a cease-fire is not agreed to prior to 21 July,

it will be necessary for the Assembly to approve the

sending of conscripts to Indochina. Paris 66 to Dulles,

Dulles informs Eden that it is “better if neither Bedell

nor I went back” to Geneva since the French will probably
Settle for worse than the 7-point agreement, hence it

would be embarrrassing to all concerned. Dulles NIACT

The U.S, feels that elections mean eventual unification

of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh and therefore should be

held "as long after a cease-fire agreement as possible

and in conditions free from intimidation...." Further,

the U.S. believes no date should be set now and that no
conditions be accepted which would affect international
supervision of elections. The U.S. would not oppose a
settlement based on the 7-points nor would we seek to

upset a settlement by force. Dulles 77 to Paris,
