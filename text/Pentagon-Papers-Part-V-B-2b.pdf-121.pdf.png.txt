appreciable forewarning. Although reliable reports do not indicate
the presence of armored units on the Indochina border, a
division of armored cars, plus a battalion of tanks attached to

the Fourth Field Army, are stationed in South China within 700
miles of the frontier, Moreover, approximately 150,000 additional
Chinese Communist troops could arrive at the Indochina border with-
in ten days to bolster initial invading forces, Even in the

event of a simultaneous assult on Taiwan, these feinforcements
would be availeble and would bring the potential invading force to
a totel of at least 250,000 troops. In view of the Chinese
Communists’ improving capability for waterlift, it is possible
that some Invasion forces inight be moved by sea to Viet Minh-hold
sections of the Indochina coast. There is no evidence, however,

of Chinese Communist preparations for such a move,

"Although there have been no indications of any significant
build-up of Chinese Communist Air Force strength in Southwest
China and although this air force has not yet appeared in combat,
the estimated 200-250 operational combat types (including fighters
and light bombers) in the Chinese Communist Air Force could
furnish effective air support to operations in Indochina,
There are six airfields in Chine within 170 miles of the Tonkin border.
In addition, construction of new airfields and the restoration
of others in Southwest China are reportedly in progress in the
Tonkin Kwengsi border area and on Heinan Island,"

5. Viet Minh Milit Capabilities (ORE 50-50

"The forces of Ho Chi Minh, which have been engaged in resist-
ance activities against the Reenciket ace September 1945, are
capable of expanding their operations, Ho's organization,
commonly known as the ‘Viet Minh’, possesses approximately 92,500
regular troops and an estimated 130,000 irregulars. The Viet
Minh forces include 2,000 Khmer Issaraka in Cambodia and 500
Issaraks in Laos,

"The Viet Minh forces are geared primarily for guarrilla
warfere, The demonstrated effectiveness of a few task forces, each
totaling as many as three to five thousand men and equiped with
adequate infantry weapons and some artillary, points to a developing
capability for more conventional warfare, Under present cir-
cumstances, the Viet Minh should have little difficulty in main-
taining relative freedom of action throughout most of indochina,
while simulteneously supporting pockets of resistance within
French-oceupied territory and continuing to harass French lines
of communication, In addition, the Viet Minh is capable of
seising one or more French bord der outposts and holding them for
a short time at Least,
