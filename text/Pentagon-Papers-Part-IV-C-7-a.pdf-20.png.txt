Hanoi power plant bombed

McNamara DPM (given to the
President)

As a part of the policy review,
McNaughton drafts a proposal
for cutting the bombing back
to 20°. The action was to
enhance military effectiveness
not improve negotiation pros-
pects, which were dim.

After considering three options:
closing Haiphong, heavier
attacks in the Hanoi-Haiphong
area and restriction of bombing
to the panhandle only, Rostow
recommended concentrating on the
panhandle while holding open

the option to up the ante farther
north if we desired later.

Bundy considers five different
bombing packages and finally
favors levelling off at current
levels with no new targets and
more concentration on the pan-
handle.

The bombing has not eroded

NVN morale, materially degraded
NVN ability to support the war,
nor significantly eroded the
industrial-military base.

As the debate continues, the
President approves the Hanoi
power plant.

The power plant, 1 mile from
the center of Hanoi, is hit
for ‘the first time.

McNamara considered two courses:
approval of the military recon-
mendations for escalation in
both North and South; de-escala-
tion in the North (20°) and only
30,000 troops in the South. In
spite of unfavorable negotiations
climate, the second course is
recommended because costs and
risks of the lst course were too
great.
