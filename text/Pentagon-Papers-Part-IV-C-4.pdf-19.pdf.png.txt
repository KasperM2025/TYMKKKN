"Estimate of the

Situation in SVN"
Saigon Airgram to
State

DESCRIPTION

Secretary. Again, the use of U.S. troops
for active anti-insurgent operations was
not mentioned.

This said the 9th MEB was needed as soon
as possible for base security, to boost
the GVN war against the Viet Cong, to
provide insurance in case the GVN was
unable to resist collapse in the critical
Da Nang area where so much was already
committed. CINCPAC said the "single most
important thing we can do quickly to im-
prove the security situation in South
Vietnam is to make full use of our air
power."

Announced two USMC Battalion Lending Teams
-- 3500 men -- were being deployed to
Vietnam on a limited mission: to provide

â€˜base security and relieve GVN forces for

pacification and offensive operations
against the Viet Cong.

Ordered the BLT's to commence landing.

Secretary Rusk said the Marines would
shoot back if shot at, but their mission
was to put 4 tight security ring around
Da Nang -- not to kill Viet Cong.

The Mission Council reported insurgency
would grow unless "...NVN support is. .
checked, GVN military and paramilitary
resources increased, pacification goals

* and concepts refined, administrative -

efficiency improved and an adequate
political-psychological base created....
Only U.S. resources can provide the
pressures on NVIV necessary to check
Hanoi's support although some measure

of GVN armed forces participation will
be required for psychological reasons;
the other measures and programs required
to stem the tide...are largely internal
to SVN but even here success will require
& marked increase in U.S. support and
participation."
