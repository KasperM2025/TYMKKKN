III. PROGRAM No. 4

A. Planning Begins for cY 67
1. CINCPAC's 18 June Request

However, even before the Secretary of Defense published Program
No. 3, CINCPAC had submitted his Calendar Year 1966 adjusted requirements
and Calendar Year 1967 requirements. 1/

CINCPAC's requirements were based on a new concept for Vietnam.
The four basic objectives remained as they had been set forth in CINCPAC's
February concept. A new item in the June concept was that US/FWMAF and
RVNAF general reserves and ARVN corps reserve forces would conduct sus-
tained and coordinated operations with increased effort in the Highlands
and along the western ARVN border. This was in line with the genera ty
increased emphasis given in the concept to restricting wvA/ve forces'
access to the coastal and land borders of ARVN through effective land,
sea, and air interdiction operations.

During this time, two slightly different estimates of eneny
strength were available. The figures used by CINCPAC in their 18 June
submission were 125 confirmed, 7 probable, and 18 possible battalions in
South Vietnam. It was estimated that the enemy was capable of infiltrat-
ing up to 15 battalion equivalents (9,000 personnel) per month into South
Vietnam unless denied capability to do so. It was also estimated that the
enemy could train 7 VC battalion equivalents (3,500 personnel) per month
under the current existing situation. However, the best estimate of his
intentions was that he would attempt to reinforce at the rate of 18.5
battalion equivalents (11.5 NVA, and 7 VC) per month, which would give
him a maximum build-up total of 180 battalion equivalents by March 1967,
at which time losses would exceed inputs and total VC strength would
begin to decline.

The estimate of VC strength given in NIE 1).3-66, 2/ was as follows:
The total Communist force in South Vietnam was estimated to be between
260,000 and 280,000. ‘The major combat elements included some 38,000
North Vietnamese troops, approximately 63,000 regular main and local
forces and from 100 - 200,000 guerrillas. The North was estimated to
have a capability to infiltrate from 75,000 to 100,000 individual re-
placements, but present evidence suggested that the probable infiltration
would be between 55,000 and 75,000. The estimate of VC recruiting in. the
South was from {,000 to 10,000 a month. A prujection of strength for end
of 1966 was 125,000 in the Communist regular forces, but this could groiw
by the end of 1967 to over 150,000. ‘The estimated strength for 1 January
1967, in terns of battalions, was between 170 and 190.
