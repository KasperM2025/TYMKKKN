CHRONOLOGY

1 Jul 65 Under SecState George Ball Ball argues for “cutting our
memo to the President losses" in Vietnam and nego-

tiating an end to the war. A
massive US intervention would
likely require complete achieve- -
ment of our objectives or
humiliation, both at terrible
costs.

Rusk memo to the President US had to defend South Vietnam
from aggression even with US
troops to validate the reli-
ability of the US commitment.

McNamara DPM .(revised The gravity of the military

20 Jul) situation required raising 3rd
country troops in SVN from 16
to 4h battalions and intensify-
ing the air war through the
mining of Haiphong and other
ports, destruction of rail and
road bridges from China, and
destruction of MIG airfields
and SAM sites.

2 Jul 65 JCSM 515-65 The JCS advocate virtually the
same air war program as the
DPM adding only attacks on
"war-making" supplies and facil-
ities. Sorties should increase
from 2,000 to 5,000.

13 Jul 65 McNaughton draft memo Negotiations are unlikely, but
even 200,000-400,000 men may
only give us a 50-50 chance of
& win by 1968; infiltration
routes should be hit hard to
put a “ceiling” on infiltration.

14-21 Jul 65 McNamara trip to Vietnem After a week in Vietnam,

McNamara returned with a4
softened version of the DPM.
