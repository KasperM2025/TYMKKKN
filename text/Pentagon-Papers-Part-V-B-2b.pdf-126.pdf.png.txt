3. Views of the U.S. Minister in Saigon. On 19 September,

Minister Heath, in Saigon, reported as follows:
"ghere is little doubt in our minds here thet it we are to find

a fairly rapid cure for this ‘civil war' which invites further Chinese
intervention, native forces in the field must be greatly increased.
This will, of course, involve more equipment and cash. lLTegation can-
not state, of course, whether or how much it would be possible for
French Government to increase its cash outlay in Indochina at this time.
French finances might be able to afford some increase in their Indochina
budgets. If they cannot, however, meet full bill for maintenance of
increased national army and urgently needed pacification troops, then
we shall be obliged to contribute some direct financial aid if we want
this dangerously festering situation cleared up. I trust that French
delegate now in Washington can provide prompt estimates as to French
and Associated States financial possibilities in this regard.

"Politically, I strongly hold opinion that purpose of national
army concept will be dissipated unless Vietnam (and Cambodia and Laos
as well) are brought into atecusasons, their wishes consulted and their
desires met to the extent that military efficiency will permit. In
this connection President Huu's most recent press conference, in which
he declared that only Viet forces could obtsin necessary rallyings and
pacification brought him close to position advocated by nationalists
of Nguyen Phen Long-lam Viet stripe. Key figure in such consultations
will, of course, be Bao Dai and I cannot emphasize too insistently my

belief that the U.S. should make no definite large-scale commitments
