DESCRIPTION

In a repetition of the 2 August inci-
dent, the Maddox and the C. Turner Joy
are attacked. After strenuous efforts
to confirm the attacks, the President
authorizes reprisal air strikes against
the North.

US aircraft attack several DRV patrol
beat bases, destroying ships and
facilities.

At the time of the attacks, the Presi-~
dent briefed leaders of Congress, and
had a resolution of support for US
policy introduced. It is passed with
near-unanimity by both Houses.

Khanh announces a state of emergency
that gives him near-dictatorial powers.

tn his first monthly report to the
President, Taylor gives a gloomy view
of the political situation and of
Khanh's capacities for effectively
pursuing the war. He is equally pessi-
mistic about other aspects of the situ-
ation. ;

The President signs the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution and pledges full support
for the GVN.

Khanh discusses with Taylor his plan
to draw up a new constitution enhanc-
ing his own powers. Taylor tries to
discourage him.

At GVN NSC meeting, Khanh shows Taylor
his proposed draft Constitution.
Taylor dislikes its blatant ratifica-
tion of Khanh as dictator.

With the promulgation of the new con-

stitution, Khanh is elected President
by the MRC.
