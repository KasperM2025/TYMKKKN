6. In addition to the foregoing general recommendation, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff would make the following specific recommendation regard-
ing that part of the third paragraph of the subject paper headed:

' REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS which states:

"For the United States to underwrite a regional coalition
including Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand
does not increase American commitments; we must accept respon-
sibility for assisting in the defense of these powers against
ageression."

The Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the military point of view, disagree in
principle with such a single far-flung regional arrangement and do not
concur in the statement that American commitments would not be increased
by underwriting such a coalition. The Joint Chiefs of Staff would from
the military point of view agree to appropriate military arrangements
between nations in Southeast Asia capable of effective mutual support.

7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff desire to reaffirm their views on this
subject as transmitted by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of
State on 14 April, and reemphasize the need for immediate consideration
and implementation of an integrated and effective U.S. course of action

for Southeast Asia.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff
