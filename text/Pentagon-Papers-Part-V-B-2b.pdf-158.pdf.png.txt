First Meeting, December 4, 1950

Secretary Acheson:...This moment for negotiation :
with the communist movement is the worst since 1917. if
we do not negotiate and do not have a settlement, what
do we do? We may fight as hard as we can in Korea,
keeping going as long as possible, punishing the enemy
as much as we can. Our negotiating position would be
no worse then. If we are pushed out later and cannot
hold Korea, we are still on the islands. We must refuse
to recognize their gains. We could make as much trouble
for the Chinese Communists as possible and hold Formosa,
retaining what strength we can. If the Communists are
. Successful in Korea, this may so weaken the French in \

Indochina that they will pull out. He doubted if any
one of the President!s advisers would urge him to inter-
vene in that situation.
