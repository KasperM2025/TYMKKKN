Although the conditions stipulated in December had not been met, although
the program continued to fall further behind, we were fully committed to

all Service Secretaries, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Chief of Naval Opera-

Over the past two or three years I have emphasized the importance
of providing all necessary military assistance to South Vietnam,
