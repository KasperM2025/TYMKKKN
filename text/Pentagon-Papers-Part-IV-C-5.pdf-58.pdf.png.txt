TOP SECRET - Sensitive

Confirmed strength -- 37,000 Regular Troops
100,000 Irregulars and Guerrillas (approx)

5 Regimental Headquarters
50 Battalions

145 Separate Companies
35 Separate Platoons

All of these figures reflected substantial increases over the previous
year. In fact, the confirmed strength had risen no less than 33% since
1964. After the Viet Cong had demonstrated rather bluntly that the
March 1965 statistics were a trifle conservative, the order of battle was
revised and on 21 July appeared as follows: 25/

Confirmed strength -- 53,000 Regular Troops
100,000 Irregulars and Guerrillas (no change
from previous figure which was itself
an estimate)

10 Regional Headquarters

72 Battalions ;
192 Separate Companies
101 Separate Platoons

In light of subsequent information, even the above estimate, gloomy as it
was, understated the enemy strength. Opposing the Viet Cong forces were

the RVNAF Regular, Regional, and Popular Forces totaling some 570,000 men

and boasting at best 133 infantry-type battalions. 26/ At a quick glance,
the force ratios in July were seen to be about 3.8 to 1 in favor of the

GVN in manpower (with the RVN Police and some paramilitary forces such as

the Armed Combat Youth not being counted and about 1.9 to 1 in favor of the
GVN in maneuver battalions. Undoubtedly the force ratios as seen in mid-1965
were far from optimum for theoretical counterinsurgency operations.

C. Pacification

The program to pacify, or extend government control over, the
countryside never really recovered from the political turmoil of 1964 and
early 1965. The 1965 master plan for "Rural Reconstruction" (one of many
such euphemisms) was not approved by the RVNAF High Command until after
the first quarter of the year. 27/ Situation reports, both MACV and CIA,
described incremental plusses and minuses in what was obviously overall a
stalled program.

On 6 April, a MACV military spokesman gave the following answers
to questions from the press after a presentation summing up the month of

March 1965: 28/
