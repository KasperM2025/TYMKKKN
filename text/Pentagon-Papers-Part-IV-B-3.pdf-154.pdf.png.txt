Advisory logistics Teams (MALTs) to support the RF/PF. Altogether,
the conference produced some fifty-odd recommendations from which a
30-point package was forwarded to COMUSMACV.

On 15 Decenber, General Westmoreland gave his approval to the new
system which was to be phased in during 1968, the first half by the end
of March and the rest by the end of that year. By the end of December
1967, MACV was recommending a further increase of 366 advisors for the
FY 1969 program, primarily for district level intelligence slots.

Meanwhile, on September 28, the JCS had forwarded with their endorse-
ment the MACV-CINCPAC recommendation on RVNAF force increases, of which
the R/PF component was the largest. 217/ Requested was an increase
in FY 68 RVNAF authorized strength from 622,153 to 685,739, a net of
63,586. Of this number, 47,839 were RF/PF spaces, and only 15,77 were
for the regular forces (of which ARVN's share was 14,966). To achieve
these higher levels, MACV proposed the reduction of the draft age from
20 to 18 and the extension of tours of duty for active RVNAI personnel. .
The advisory support for these new Vietnamese forces had already been
provided for by Program #5. In their concluding paragraph, the JCS took
note of a MACV request, to be considered separately, for an FY 1969 RVNAP
authorized strength of 763,953, a further increase of 78,204 over the
newly proposed FY 1968 level. Of these new troops, 69,000 were to go
to RF/PF (including some draftees) and only 9,000 to ARVN. Secretary
McNamara approved these requested FY 1968 augmentations for RVNAF against
the recommendation of his Systems Analyst, Alein Enthoven, who would
have authorized only half of the request pending better justification. 218/
But the JCS were informed that a judgment on the proposed FY 1969 increase
would be reserved until the military had responded to a series of questions
relating to equipment availability, officer supply, costs, and distribu-
tion of the new forces between ARVN and RE/PP. ;

Thus, by the fall of 1967, two factors were pushing U.S, leaders
toward increasing the size and role of RVNAF in the war -- a step which
would increase the importance of the U.S. as advisor rather than combatant:
(1) the approaching ceiling on U.S. forces deployable to Vietnam without
mobilization (politically unpalatable in an election year); and (2) a
growing U.S. Congressional and public clamor for a larger South Viet-
nemese contribution to the war and assumption of burdens.

This was essentially the situation that existed when, on 31 January
1968, the VC/NVA launched a series of major attacks on South Vietnamese
population centers. This radical change in enemy tactics challenged
the efficacy of the division of effort between U.S. forces and RVNAF,
shook U.S. public support for the war, and marked the beginning of a
new, uncharted phase in the history of U.S. attempts to advise the govern-
ment and armed forces of the Republic of Vietnam.
