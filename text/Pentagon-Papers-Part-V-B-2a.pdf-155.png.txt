Responsible Foreign Office officials states that according
to Chinese information very little enthusiasm had been
aroused among Indochina natives by news of formation of
government by General Nguyen Van Xuan. He expressed doubt
that mich more result would be obtained by new group

than was attained by local administrative committees,
unless Bao Dai came back. He believed Bao Dai was
adopting wait-and-see attitude and that his decision
whether to return would wait upon signs of favorable
reaction to government by native elements. Upon being
questioned, officials said latter point would in his
view be more important with Bao Dai than question of
independence; that Bao Dai would himself in the end accept
about what Bollaert has already offered (given appearance
of popular support) despite counsel of most his advisers
to hold firm for independence, and this even though he
incurred risk of playing role of Henry Pu Yi for French.
He said Bao Dai's supporters are insisting more strongly
on foreign policy independence, being less intractable

on question of military control, probably in realization
that native levies would be incapable for some time of
putting down any continuing internal revolt.

While all Chinese elements are not one on line of action
+o be followed in Indochina, Foreign Office itself seems
to distrust Bao Dai, viewing him as possible vehicle for
restoration French prewar status. At same time many
officials plainly give evidence Chinese wish to keep on
freiendly terns with Ho Chi Minh. As indicated in EMBTEL
251, February 12, 1947, Chinese problem is to channel

and in time capture or at least hold veta cover power
