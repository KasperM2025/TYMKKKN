do not wish share Iranco-Vietnamese responsibility for
conduct operations. However, if interested Departments
this Government are to urge Congress to make necessary
appropriations for Indochina for FY 54, those Departments
must be convinced that necessarily top secret strategic
plans for Indochina are sound and can be and will be
aggressively and energetically prosecuted.

Third, I share concern frequently expressed in French
circles regarding adequacy of the financial contribution
to prosecution of war derived from residents of the
Associated States including French businessmen. â€˜hile I
welcome increased Vietnamese Government contribution re-
cently made, I believe there is ground for thoroughgoing
re-examination this problem into which balance of payment
and rate of exchange considerations enter and which of
course is of interest to us in its bearing upon the need
for US aid.

Fourth, I look forward to opportunity talking with
my French colleagues on question of free world policy in
Far East as whole and particularly the policies which we
should adopt in order to discourage further Chinese
Communist aggression. I hope to reach agreement that
speedy defeat of Viet Minh forces in Indochina would
deter rather than provoke Chinese Communist aggression in
Tonkin since it would be a clear indication of our joint
determination to meet force with effective force.

Fifth, I should appreciate receiving any views
which my French friends may care to convey regarding re-
lations between the US and the Associated States of
Indochina and particularly regarding participation by
latter in discussions of military and economic policy
and in reception of US aid. END QUOTE

Please handle on strictly oral basis and let me have
reaction. The specified points are designed to be explora-
tory; I would welcome any ideas French may wish to convey
on these or other topics prior to our conversations,
