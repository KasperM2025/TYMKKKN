and security be established in Saigon.

7. It is likewise extremely importent that program
directives be issued at an early stage by the central govern-
nent to lower echelons for proper implementation of all aspects
of the program for giving villagers protection.

8. We also urge early revitalization of the amnesty
program.

9. We are encouraged by the exploratory talks which
the Vietnamese Government has held with Cambodian Govern-
ment officials for improving relations between the two coun-

negotiations for the settlement of their bilateral problems.

10. We accept with pleasure General Minh's invitation
to set up an American brain-trust to work with his government

the distribution of ATID commodities because they controlled all Saigon
warehouses set aside for these commodities, even though the warehouses,
like the commodities, belonged to the Vietnamese. 14/

Among the many problems that were to keep recurring was that of
freedom of the press. Following an initial honeymoon period after the
coup, trouble broke out between GVN and the U.S. press corps. This reached
a climax with the temporary barring of the New York Times from Vietnamese
distribution channels when it ran a story reporting dissension among the
Vietnamese Generals. 15/ In general, Lodge sided with GVN on this issue,
as shown in his reported views at the November, 1963, Honolulu Conference:

"The U.S. press should be induced to leave the new
government alone. They have exerted great influence on
