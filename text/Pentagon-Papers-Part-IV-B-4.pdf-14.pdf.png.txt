TOP SECRET - Sensitive

Directed CINCPAC to revise the
CPSVN and progrem the with-
drawal of 1,000 men by the end .
of 1963. Force reduction was
to be by US unite (not indi-
viduals); units were to be
replaced by specially treined
RVIAF units. Withdrawal plans
were to be contingent upon
continued progress in the
counterinsurgency campaign.

CINCPAC recommended some changes,
then approved MACV's revision of
the CPSVN and the MACV plan for
withdrawal of 1,000 men. As
instructed, those 1,000 men were
draw irom logistic and service
support slots; actual operations
would be unaffected by thelr eb-
sence.

ISA's proposed MAP-Vietnem
program based on the Secre-
tary's Instructions was

rejected as still too high.

CINCPAC was directed to

develop three alternative

MAP plans for FY¥s 1965-69

based on these levels;

$535 M (CPSVN recommendation)
: $450 M (Compromise)

$365 M (SecDef goal)

MAP for FY 1954 had been set

at $150 M.

Reflected temporary and tenuous abatement of GVN-Buddhist hostili-
ties which flared up in May. The truce was repudiated almost
immediately by both sides. Buddhist alienation from the GYN
polarized; hostilities spread.

Reported the military situation was unaffected by the political
erleis; GVN prospects for continued counterinsurgency progress
were "certainly better" than In 1962; VC activity was reduced
but VC capability essentially. unimpaired.

CINCPAC suggented military

assistance programs at the

three levels set by the Jcs
but recommended edoption of
a fourth Plan developed by

CINCPAC. "Plan J" totalled
$450.9 M over the five-year
period.

Rather suddenly, Viet Cong offensive actions were reported high
for the third consecutive veek; the implication was that the vc
were capitalizing on the political crisis and might step up the
insurgency.

Discounted the importance of increased VC activity; the compara-
tive magnitude of attecks was low; developments did not yet seem
felient or lasting.

* This decree plus repressive measures against the Buddhists

shattered hopes of reconcillation, and irrevocably isolated
the Diem government.
