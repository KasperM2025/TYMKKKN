meetings being brolen up, we should have a lot of discussion
so that the public relations can be properly prepared.

We would also get the benefit from the Indian resolution.
Mr. Lioyd hoped there would not be an instruction of the
U.S. Government to the UN Command of which others would

be given very little advance notice. If the talks are

going badly, then we want to be very careful how they

are broken up.

In conclusion, Mr. Lloyd summarized his position by
saying that in his view disarmament should wait, Germany
should wait, and that Austria might well be tried. He
was most worried, he said, about how Indochina fitted
into the picture. It would be very helpful for us to
discuss how we see the Indochina campaign developing
and what action in the political field we can take to
help the French government. He did not quite see how
it fits into the picture of how we are to deal with the
Soviet Union.

As regards the question whether Germany or dis-
armament should first be discussed, let it be supposed
that it were Germany. In thet case, M. Bidault was not
sure whether the influence of public opinion in Germany
and in France would not become very strong. There are
those who think the German danger as big as the Russian
danger. If Germany were then neutralized, we would have
a vacuum at the center of the Continent. There would
be great difficulty in refusing a proposal which weuld
keep Germany disarmed. On the other hand, if we make
disarmament the positive test this difficulty would not
exist. M. Bidault was not against other tests, as in
the case of Austria. It is not a French expert who has
said that Russia might accept the western proposal for
free elections. Germany would in e*fect be put up for
auction with both sides bidding for her, and we would be
*cauegnt in our own trap.
