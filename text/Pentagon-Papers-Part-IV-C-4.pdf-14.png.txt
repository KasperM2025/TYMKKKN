DESCRIPTION

General Throckmorton, Deputy COMUSMACV,
visited Da Nang, called the situation
grave, and doubted ARVN's ability to
provide adequate security. Throckmorton
recommended that the entire 9th MEB be
sent to Da Nang, but General Westmoreland
cut this to two Battalion Landing Teams
(BLTs) with a third to be held off-shore
in reserve. The troops were to assist
GVN forces in guarding Da Nang against
enemy ground attacks.

Ambassador Taylor voiced several strong
reservations to the idea of sending
Marines to Da Nang:

-- It reversed a long-standing policy of
avoiding commitment of ground combat
forces in SVN. Taylor was sure the
GVN would "seek to unload other ground

~ force tasks upon us"; he was sure
i

this deployment would invite requests
for more troops to meet additional and
ultimately defensive offensive require-
ments.

-- Two BLT's would not release significant
numbers of ARVN for mobile operations
against the Viet Cong; the Marines
would simply be performing static
defense tasks inadequately done by
ARVN in the past.

-- Anticipating that using U.S. troops
for active operations would grow more
attractive, Taylor warned against it.
The "white-faced" soldier cannot be
assimilated by the population, he
cannot distinguish between friendly
and unfriendly Vietnamese; the Marines
are net armed, trained or equipped for
jungle guerrilla warfare. Taylor
prophesied that the U.S. +-- like France

-- would fail to adapt to such condition.

-- Two BLT's could help but could not make
Da Nang secure. The entire MEB might
, Significantly improve things, but no
force could prevent surprise mortar
attacks, a favorite VC tactic.
