a/ All FY 67 statistics based on actual figures for the first quarter and
projections for final three.

b/ Program 3 through change 21. Assumes forces hold at June 1967 levels.

e/ Based on annual planning factors of P38 ,432($234) per man-year for per-
sonnel spending, P43,200($540) per man-year for O&M and, for construction:

 Secdef "308
FY 67 on 75878: 7,961
CY 67 6,702 8,343
cy’ 68 1,386 4,551

The table clearly illustrated that with the deployment of 163,000
troops the CY 67 goal of Pl2 billion is feasible. The planning factors
used, however, entail a "pushing down" of O&M and personal spending from
the MACV planning factors ($360 per man year for personal spending,
$600 for O&M) in light of past performance and likely future savings; .
application of the MACV planning factors result in P46 billion piaster
‘spending. If these later planning factors hold, the Pl6 spending rate
would increase the inflationary gap by hoy and would be a severe blow
to the stabilization program. If inflation occurs and U.S. expenditures
are maintained in constant dollar terms, piaster expenditures will in-
erease and the problem will be worsened. If the CINCPAC construction
program were approved, similar problems would result. It appears impera-
tive to adopt a plan, such as the one exemplified in the table above,
which will call for a strong effort to reduce spending below the levels
enbodied in the MACV planning factors.

In addition to U.S. military spending, stabilization of the SVN

economy requires strict limitation of RVMAP spending. We must plan to
support the RVHAF at no nisher than the Smbassador's requested level of

o
P50 billion during CY 67.
