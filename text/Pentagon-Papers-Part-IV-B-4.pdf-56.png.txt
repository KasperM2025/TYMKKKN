DEMISE OF THE CPSVN

Before the month of March was over the CPSYN, as well as the MAP
pianning that had been such an integral part of it, finally received the
coup de grace. Sacrificed to the U.S. desire "to make it clear that we
fully support" the GVN, they were formally terminated, for the record, on
27 March in the OSD message reproduced below:

FROM: OSD WASH DC DEF 963028 Date: 27 March 196):
(Col. W. J. Yates)
TO: CINCPAC

REFS: a. CINCPAC 1106262 Mar 64
b. DEF 959615 DIG 132352Z Mar 64

1. As indicated in ref. b., ceiling for Vietnam FY 66 MAP is
$143.0 million against $143.1 million for FY 65. Requirements
above these program levels should be identified as separate packages.

2. Submission of five-year programs FY 66-70 for Vietnam is
suspended until further notice. Your best estimates of FY 66

withdrawing U.S. personnel where their roles can be assumed by
South Vietnamese and of sending additional men if they are needed.
It will remain the policy of the U.S. to furnish assistance and
support of South Vietnam for as long as is required to bring
Communist aggression and terrorism under control. Unquote.

4, No further action required or being taken here relative to
accelerated model plan.

Thus ended dejure the policy of phase out and withdrawal and all the
plans and programs oriented to it. Shortly, they would be cancelled out
de facto.

BUILD-UP OF THE U.S. FORCE COMMITMENT

Soon the whole evolutionary direction of the U.S. military commit-
ment began to change. Rather than diminishing, the magnitude rose there-
after. In early May the approved U.S. military strength ceiling for South
Vietnam was raised by more than 1500 so that total in-country authorization
came to over 17,000. Further increases were in sight. 63/ As the mili-
tary situation in Vietnam failed to show signs of amerliorating, pressures
