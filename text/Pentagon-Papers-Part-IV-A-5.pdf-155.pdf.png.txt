Fall's thesis was challenged by a senior U.S. adviser to the GVN, who
argued that the increasing casualty figures represented not a structured
attempt to overthrow the GVN, but were simply a product of police
reporting in the hinterlands. 140/ There can be no doubt that the latter
view was partially correct: neither the U.S. nor the GVN knew what was
“normal” in the rural areas, and police reporting, with U.S. aid, had been
improved. But the deadly figures continued to mount. George A. Carver
of the CIA, in his 1966 Foreign Affairs article, agreed with Fall:

"A pattern of politically motivated terror began to emerge,
directed against the representatives of the Saigon government and
concentrated on the very bad and the very good. The former were
liquidated to win favor with the peasantry; the latter because
their effectiveness was a bar to the achievement of Communist
objectives. The terror was directed not only against officials
but against all whose operations were essential to the functioning
of organized political society, school teachers, health workers,
agricultural officials, etc. The scale and scope of this terrorist
and insurrectionary activity mounted slowly and steadily. By the
end of 1958 the participants in this incipient insurgency, whom Saigon
quite accurately termed the "Viet Cong," constituted a serious threat
to South Viet Nam's political stability." 141/

Like most other statistics concerning Vietnam, figures on the extent
of the terrorism varied widely. The GVN reported to the ICC that in 1957,
1958, and tne first half of 1959, Viet Cong murdered 65 village officials,
51 civilians, 28 Civil Guardsmen, and 10 soldiers. 1ke/; GVN official
reports provided the U.S. Embassy in Saigon recorded a significantly greater
toll of civilians:

Journalists and scholars, studying open sources, put the figures even
higher. Douglas Pike reported 1700 assassinations and 2000 abductions in
the years 1957-1960. 1)4/ Bernard Fall estimated murders of low-level
GVN officials as follows:

May 1957 May 1958 May 1959 May 1960 May 1961
700 1200 2500 4.000

Fall reported that the GVN lost almost 20% of its village chiefs in 1957
