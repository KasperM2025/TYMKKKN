Covert GVN coastal
operations against
DRV again authorized

Joint State/Defense
message 313 to
Vientiane

DESCRIPTION

scored 2 number of hits. No
return fire was received from

the "attackers." Later bn the

18th the President suspended
the DESOTO patrols which were
not to be resumed until Febru-
ary 1965.

The CJCS endorsed the proposals
of the mission representatives
and requested immediate authority
to implement air operations

in the Laotian panhandle with
RIAF T-28s and U.S. aircraft

for suppressive fire and attack-
ing heavily defended targets.
Authority for GV] ground intelli-
gence acquisition patrols in the
Iaotian corridor was also sought.

The deterioration of GVN morale
and effectiveness continued
unabated and this intelligence
estimate did not think that the
hoped for civilian government
would-be able to reverse it.

The VC were not, however, ex-
pected to make an overt military
effort to capture the govern-
ment.

The President authorized reacti-
vation of the covert coastal
strikes by the GVN against the
DRV, under very tight controls
with each action to be cleared
in advance by OSD, State and

the White House.

The Embassy is authorized to
urge the Laotian Government

to begin T-28 strikes as soon
as possible against a 22-target
list which excluded the Mu Gia
pass. Some of the targets
were designed for U.S. YANKEE
TEAM strikes.
