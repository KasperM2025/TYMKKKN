OUTGOING TELEGRAM

SENT TO: Amembkassy PARIS 4907 March 19, 1953

Recent Paris working-level discussions added sub-

Please express to Foreign liinister my appreciation for
cooperation all concerned. Also take early opportunity

when Mayer, Bidault and Letourneau come to Washington
they will furnish further particulars regarding French
Government's plans and resulting requirements. It may
be helpful to them in formulating their position to ex-
press to them informally some of considerations involved
not only in matter of additional aid but also in continv-
ation American assistance at present substantial level.
Considerations are:

First, Government and people of US are fully aware
of importance -to free world of war being waged in Indo-
china by armies of France and Associated States. They
appreciate sacrifices which have been and are being made
and degree to which Communist plans have been thwarted by
magnificent defense carried out in Indochina against
Communist aggression,

Second, we envisage Indochina situation with real
sense of urgency. We believe continued military stale-
mate will produce most undesirable political consequences
in Indochina, France and U.S. Therefore, we heartily
agree that â€˜considerable inereased effort having as its aim
liquidation principal regular enemy forces within period
of, say, twenty-four months is essential. We obviously
