Annex "I") With 2 exceptions the training was good, with Ansrican
Angee such as the "committee system!" frequently used. The training
witnessed in several training installations indicated out standing
aggressiveness and imagination on the pare of installation commanders.
However, many training ere are were operating at less than 50% capacity
Vand suffered from lack of uniformity of instruction, lack of or fature
to use necessary training aids, poor organization of instruction and
lack of central command supervision.
18. Responsibility with respect to the tratntes of the armies of

the Associated States is poorly defined and I feel that the key to the
training problem lies in reorganization to achieve real command supervi-

sion. This can be accomplished through the Grea tkerecn of a beg MAAG,

to supervise all training—-Army, Navy, and Air, for the military forces of
the Assuotated States, along the lines of our KAMAG in Korea. General
Navarre has agreed to this concept. Furthermore, General Navarre has.
agreed to the inelusion of 3 U. S. officers in the French MAAG, with 2

French officers in turn working with General Trapnell's organization.

National Armies of the Associated States. I do not believe that direct
U. S. participation in the training of the Armies of the Associated
States is either desirable or feasible, primarily because it is un-
necessary, manpower requirements would be very large and the French would
