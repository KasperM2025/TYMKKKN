3 Nov 1961 option was tied to a U.S. response
(Continued) to renewed fighting in Laos and/or

overt invasion of South Vietnam.
But Taylor suggested troops be sent
to Diem; the Taylor Report end
cables recommend combat troop de-
ployment to Vietnem. (A message
from Nolting summarizing the Diem-
Taylor meeting on which the recom-
mendations apparently rest (Saigon
message 541, 25 Oct 61) does. not
indicate any enthusiasm on Diem's
part to deployment of troops, how-
ever. He hinted U.S. troops for
training might be requested, then
dropped the subject.)

Appendices to the Taylor Report
written by members of the group

give a slightly different picture.
There is less optimism about the
GVN's chances of success, less
optimism about chances of U.S.
action -- political or military --
tipping the balance. For exemple:
Williem Jordan (State) said almost
all Vietnamese interviewed had em-
phasized the gravity of the situation,
growing VC successes and loss of
confidence in Diem. The ARVN lacked
aggressiveness, was devoid of any
sense of urgency, short of able
leaders. Sterling Cottrell (State)
said: It is an open question whether
the GVN can succeed even with U.S,
assistance. Thus it would be a mis-
take to meke an irrevocable U.S.
commitment to defeat communists in
South Vietnam. Foreign militery
forces cannot win the battle at the
village level -- where it must be
joined; the primary responsibility
for saving Vietnam must rest with
the GVN. For these reasons Cottrell
argued against a treaty which would
either shift ultimate responsibility
to the U.S. or engage a full U.S.
commitment to defeat the Vietcong.
