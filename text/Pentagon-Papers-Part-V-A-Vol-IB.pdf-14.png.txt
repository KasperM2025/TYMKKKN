"MR, SMITH: Yes, it is. If Indochina is lost to the Communists,
Burma is threatened, Thailand is threatened, the Malay Peninsula is
exposed, Indonesia is subject to the gravest danger, and, in addition to
these countries and their possible loss, there is the possible loss of
food source. I have already mentioned the strategic raw materials, the
bases in the area: and, while they are of enormous importance, the most
important thing of all is the possible loss of millions and millions
of people who would disappear behind the Iron Curtain. There are enough

"The gallant defenders of Dien-Bien-Phu have done their part to
assure a frustration of the Communist strategy. They have taken a toll
such that, from a military standpoint, the attackers already lost more

Dien-Bien-Phu have dramatized the struggle for freedom so that the free
world sees more clearly than ever before the issues that are at stake
and once again is drawing closer together in unity of purpose.

"The Communist rulers are learning egain that the will of the free
