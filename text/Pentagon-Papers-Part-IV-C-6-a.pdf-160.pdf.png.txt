An early plumbing of this line was an article in early 1965 by
Hanson W. Baldwin, entitled: "We Must Choose -- (1) 'Bug Out';
(2) Negotiate; (3) Fight." He wrote:

"How many United States soldiers would be needed is
uncertain ~- probably a minimum of three to six divisions
(utilized chiefly in battalion or brigade sized units),
possibly as many as 10 or 12 divisions. Including Air Force,
Navy and supporting units perhaps 200,000 to 1,000,000 Ameri-
cans would be fighting in Vietnam.

"Obviously this would mean a Korea type conflict, a
major war, no matter what euphemisms would be used. Nor
could we wage it in the present "business as usualâ€™ economy.
We would require partial mobilization, vastly beefed up
military production. Many weaknesses in our military struc-
ture would need strengthening. Even so, we could not antici-
pate quick success. The war would be long, nasty and wearing."
