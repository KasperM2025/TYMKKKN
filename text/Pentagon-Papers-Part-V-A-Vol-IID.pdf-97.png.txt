"It is because of the attempt to upset by violence the situation
in Viet-Nam, and its far-reaching implications elsewhere, that the
United States and other countries have responded to appeals from South
Viet-Nam for military assistance.

“Our aims in giving this assistance are strictly limited.
"We are not engaged in a ‘holy war' against communism.

"We do not seek to establish an American empire or a sphere of
influence in Asia.

"We seek no permanent military bases, no permanent establishment
of troops, no permanent alliances, no permanent American presence of
any kind in South Viet-Nan.

"We do not seek to impose a policy of alinement on South Viet-Nem.
"We do not seek to overthrow the Government of North Viet-Nam.

"We do not seek to do any injury to mainland China nor to threaten
any of its legitimate interests.

"We do not ask of North Viet-Nam an unconditional surrender or
indeed the surrender of anything that belongs to it.

"Nor do we seek to exclude any segment of the South Vietnamese
people from peaceful participation in their country's future.

"Tet me state affimmatively and succinctly what our aims are.

"We want a political solution, not a military solution, to this
conflict. By the same token, we reject the idea that North Viet-Nam
has the right to impose a military solution.

"We seek to assure for the people of South Viet-Nam the same right
of self-determination--to decide its own political destiny, free of
force--that the United Nations Charter affirms for all.

"and we believe that reunification of Viet-Nam should be decided
upon through a free choice by the peoples of both the North and the
South without outside interference, the results of which choice we are
fully prepared to support."
