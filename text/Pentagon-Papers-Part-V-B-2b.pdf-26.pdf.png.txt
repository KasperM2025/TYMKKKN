136. State and Defense recapitulate talks with the French Minis-
ters, analyze Saigon's views on Indochina, and review the
proposed NSC policy statement on Indochina: The French
had not programmed equipment for 18 battalions in the 1951
budget and further had requested that the U.S. pay for and
maintain the National armies when formed. It appears that
the French will withdraw from Tonkin and may throw the
problem to the U.N. The draft policy statement is con-
sidered quite adequate. Memorandum for the Record (Mr. K.T.
Young); 17 October 1950 <cesckcoewnnse0sevowesschecsvsueseeyee 373

and 130,000 irregulars. U.S. Naval Intelligence Memorandum,

imperative that he give the Vietnamese people evidence of
his determination to personally lead his country into immed-
iate and "energetic opposition” to the communist menace.
The U.S. has interpreted his “prolonged holiday” on the
Riviera as lack of patriotism. It is tactfully suggested
that further displays of procrastination might lead to loss
of U.S. support for his government. Acheson 384 to Saigon,

do. not quit cold and leave a political vacuum behind them."
