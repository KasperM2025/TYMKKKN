opposition elements. This policy of repression will inhibit
the growth of popularity of the regime, and we believe that
dissatisfaction will grow, particularly among those who are
politically conscious...."

began to reflect conviction that Diem's political base had in fact been
seriously eroded, and that the DRV-supported Viet Cong posed a vital
threat. The intelligence of 1960 is treated in detail in Section Cy
below; suffice to say for the purposes of this summary, mounting rural
violence validated the estimate of the 1959 NIE that a concerted and
dangerous Viet Cong attack on the GVN was underway.
