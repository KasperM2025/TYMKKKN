that would fight in the way de Lattre meant was the absence,
at Dienbienphu, of any Vietnamese fighting elements. It was
a French show." 2

Gullion is not altogether correct with respect to Dien Bien Phu;
nonetheless, statistics on the ethnic composition of the defending
garrison do reveal the nature of the problem. The 5th Vietnamese Para-
chute Battalion was dropped to reinforce the garrison so that as of
May 6, 1954, the troops at Dien Bien Phu included: 30/

Garrison of Dien Bien Phu

Officers NCO's EM's Totals

Vietnamese : 11 270 _5,119 5,480
Total 393 1,666 13,026 15,105
Viet % of Total 2.8 16.2 39.2 36.2

Thus, the Vietnamese comprised more than a third of the fighting forces
(and nearly 40% of the enlisted troops); but among the leaders, they
provided one-sixth of the non-commissioned officers and less than 3% of
the officers.

The paucity of Viet officers at Dien Bien Phu reflected
the general condition of the National Army: as of 1953, there were 2,600
native officers, of whom only a handful held rank above majoy compared
to 7,000 French officers in a force of 150,000 Vietnamese troops. 31/

(2) 1951-1953: Letourneau and "Dictatorship"

De Lattre's successor as High Commissioner, Jean
Letourneau, was also the French Cabinet Minister for the Associated
States. Letourneau was sent to Indochina to assume the same power and
privilege in the "independent" State of Vietnam that any of France's
Governor Generals had ever exercised from Saigon's Norodom Palace.
In May, 1953, a French Parliamentary Mission of Inquiry accused the
Minister-High Commissioner of "veritable dictatorship, without limitation
or control‚Äù:

"The artificial life of Saigon, the temptations of power with-
out control, the security of a judgment which disdains realities,
have isolated the Minister and his entourage and have made them
insensible to the daily tragedy of the war ...

"It is no longer up to us to govern, but to advise. The
big thing was not to draw up plans irresponsibly, but to carry
on daily a subtle diplomacy. In Saigon our representatives
have allowed themselves to be inveigled into the tempting
game of power and intrigue.
