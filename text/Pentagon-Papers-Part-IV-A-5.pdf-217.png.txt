(1) A confirmed unit/group is one which is determined to exist on
the basis of accepted direct information from a minimum of two
prisoners, returnees or captured documents (any combination,
in addition to indirect evidence).

(2) A probable infiltration unit/group is one believed to exist on
the basis of accepted direct information from one captive,
returnee, or captured document, in addition to indirect evidence.

(3) The total does not represent all the data on hand. In 1965
a "possible" category was added to show units/group thought to
be in South Vietnam on the basis of unconfirmed evidence.
Adding the "possible" category raises the totals for 1965 to
33,730. Still other information, though available, has been
considered insufficient to warrant adding to the totals.

(4) The figure shown is for both 1959 and 1960.

organized or authorized by the DRV. The DRV did appeal to them as a
group from time to time, but principally when it wished to mobilize opinion
against some deed of the GVN. For example, in December, 1958, in Diem's
"political re-education center" at Phu Loi (Thu Dau Mot), just north of
Saigon, there was an epidemic food-poisoning in which at least twenty
prisoners dies. Hanoi launched at major propaganda effort to exploit the
mishap, claiming that: 120/_
