DESCRIPTION

In the evaluation of the likely
North Vietnamese reactions to
the actions approved in the
Septenber 7 meeting, CIA con-
cluded that these would probably
be limited to defensive and
propaganda measures with possi-
bly some scaling down of opera-
tions in the South. China

was not expected to enter the
war aS @ result of even a
systematic U.S. air campaign
against the North.

Taylor reported that the ARVN
would be unable to conduct
ground operations in the Laotian
corridor in the foreseeable
future and therefore U.S. air
operations are urged. Ata
minimum, combat air patrols
supporting RIAF strike missions
were requested.

U.S. air strikes against four

defended targets are requested
to accompany RIAF T-28 strikes
in the northern panhandle.

Washington, responding to Unger's
request, authorized only U.S.
combat air patrols in support

of the RLAF operations, not the
U.S. strikes. U.S. air strikes
against communist LOCs in the
panhandle are not authorized
until much later.

The RLAF, with U.S. aireraft
in combat air patrol support,
make the first strikes against
the communist LOCs in the pan-
handle.
