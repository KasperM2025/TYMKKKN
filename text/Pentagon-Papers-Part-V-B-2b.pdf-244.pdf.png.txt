probably be led to adopt courtermeasures similar to those
taken regarding Korea if the US, UK, and France advocated
these measures, Action by the Securit ty Council would
certainly be blocked by a Soviet veto, but the malter could
then be taken to the General Asserc bly within twenty-four
hours under the “‘Uniting for Peace’ resolution, The
General Assembly would probably begin by calling for a
cease-fire. Were this action { to be ignored fas it presumably
would be), a two-thirds majority could probably y be mustered
for resolutions condemning Communist China as an aggressor,
recommending mi ilitary counteraction to repel the aggression,
and setiing up a unified mililary commard (though not
necessarily under the US) to that end. Most UN members,
however, because of their fears of a general wat, would prob-
ably not be willing to give specific authorization for military
counteraction against Coramunist China tiself,

11, The willingness of the UN to adopt a stand against
Communis! intervention in Southeast Asia would be affected
by the readiness of the victim to appeal to the UN. Indochina
and Thailand would almost certainly be prompt in seeking UN
assistance agains! Chinese Communist miliiary intervention,
but Burma might fail to make a timely appeal or fail to
_ Support an appeal by another UN member,

12, The degree of UN support for action against Chinese
Communist aggression would hinge on various other factors.
A large nurnber of Arab and Asian countries probably would ©
abstain if Indochina, which they regard as a Frerch puppet, were
invaded, The Arab-Asian reaction might be more favorable if
the victim were Burma, which has followed a peley of non-
involvement, If the five powers took any countermeasures
without UN authorization, support a their action would be
considerably lessened,
