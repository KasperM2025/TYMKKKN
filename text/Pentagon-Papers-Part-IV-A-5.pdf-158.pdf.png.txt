From mid-1959 onward, there was a definite upsurge in
Viet Cong activity, marked not only by the increase in terrorism
noted in the statistics presented above, but also by the fielding of
large military units which sought, rather than avoided, engagement
with units of Diem's regular army. On 26 September 1959 two companies
of the ARVN 23d Division were ambushed by a well-organized force of
several hundred identified as the "2d Liberation Battalion"; the ARVN
units lost 12 killed, 14 wounded, and most of their weapons. 156/

On 25 January 1960 the same Viet Cong battalion launched
an attack coordinated with four guerrilla companies -- a total force
of 300 to 500 men -- which penetrated the compound of the 3é¢d Regiment,
21st ARVN Division at Tay Ninh, killed-23 ARVN soldiers, and netted a
large haul of arms and ammunition. 157/ On 29 January 1960 an insurgent
band seized the town of Dong Xoai, some sixty miles north of Saigon, held
the place for several hours, and robbed a French citizen of 200, 000
piasters. 158/ In the same month, large VC forces opened operations in
the Camau peninsula and the Mekong Delta. In Kien Hoa province VC units
numbering hundreds effectively isolated the province capital from six of
its eight districts. 159/ Bernard Fall, in his continuing study of Viet
Cong operations, detected a new strategy operating: a shift during 1959 and
early 1960 from base development in the Delta to isolation of Saigon. 160
