JCS plan for 6 Mobile Training
Teams in each province and
training center, 70 advisors to
each critical province, increase
of 1000 personnel.

Gen. Harkins disputed the value
of U.S. conducted training for
CG/SDC and of Mobile Training
Teams; proposed advisors be used
at district level. for operations;
accepted 1000 man increase.

CINCPAC agreed with COMUSMACV
and outlined specific advisory
build-up recomnended: 956 per-
sonnel by end CY 65.

Gen. Harkins requested to
return to U.S.

USOM desire for gradual, not
rapid, build-up; need for effec-
tive local administration and
security.

One of two JCS proposals sub-
mitted to McNamara outlining
pilot program for advisory build-
up: teams in 49 districts over

6 month period, 300 advisors.

Second proposal - Broader

advisory increase program:
1000 personnel for all 239
districts over 1-15 years.

JCS opposed extending U.S,
advisors to company level,
because of increased casualties,
language problems, ARVN opposi-
tion.
