In this connection, it may be noted that the small expansion of es
U.S. military contingent in South Vietnam that occurred during 196+,
from 16,000 to 23,000 men, did not take place until after the election.

A U.S. officers' billet in the heart of Saigon which was bombed by the
VC with the loss of two Americans killed and 63 injured. It was pier
cisely the type of incident which seemed to fall within the Phase 1
guidelines as to what would justify a reprisal. The JCS recommended
such a reprisal (JCSM 1076-64, 24 December 1964, TOP SECRET), but the
timing was unpropitious--with Saigon in the throes of 2 political
crisis and Washington disinclined to launch 4 reprisal strike on 4
Christmas day.
