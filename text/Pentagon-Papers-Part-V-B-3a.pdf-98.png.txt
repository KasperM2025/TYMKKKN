SUBJECT: Flying Boxcars (C-119's) for Indochina

The JCS today approved the inmediate loan of up to six
C-119's to the French for use in Indochina to be flown by civilian
pilots,

Mr. Johnson has informed Allen Dulles and put the CIA in
touch with the proper people in the Pentagon to complete this
transaction,

The Pentagon desires to have General Trapnell (Chief of the
MAAG in Indochina) inform General Salan of this in order to
strengthen General Trapnell's position there.

We have agreed and therefore suggest that we do not inform

the French Embassy, which has been making inquiry of us, for a day
or two.
