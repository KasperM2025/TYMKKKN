MEMORANDUM FOR THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

Subj: United States Policy Toward Asia

1. I am becoming increasingly concerned et the course of
events in Asia, The advance of communism in large areas of the
world end particularly the successes of communism in Chine
seriously affect the future security of the United States, I
am aware that this critical situation is being watched closely
in the several departments of the government, and I appreciate
that the. current problems are being handled as realistically
as circumstances permit. It occurs to me, however, that this
day~ ~to-day, country-by~country approach may not develop a broad
program in our best long-range interests.

2. A major objective of United States policy, as I under.
stand it, is to contain communism in order to reduce iis threat
to our security. Our actions in Asia should be part of 4 care~
fully considered and comprehensive plan to further that objec-
tive. I therefore request that the staff of the National
Security Council undertake as soon as practicable a study of
the current situation in Asia to re-examine and correlate
current policies and to appraise the commitments and risks
involved in the various courses of action--political, economic
and military--vhich might be undertaken in support oF the broad
objective and reconmend for the consideration of the National
Security Council an appropria ute plan of action = eens
specific objectives to be achieved.
