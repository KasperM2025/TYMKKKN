White House Review

JCSM 238-66

Policy debate continues

JCS msg 9326,

Taylor memo to the
President

W. Bundy memo to Rusk

W- W. Rostow memo to
Rusk and McNamara

A general policy review at
the White House includes most
of the second-level members
of the Administration. Meet-

â€˜ings and paper drafting con-

tinued until the political
erisis in SVN abated in mid-
April.

The JCS forwarded a voluminous
study of the bombing that
recommends a much expanded
campaign to hit the Haiphong
POL, mine the harbors, hit
the airfields.

The high-level policy review
continues. Bundy, McNaughton,
Carver & Unger draft position
papers on the alternatives if
the GVN collapses.

CINCPAC is informed that RT50
will not include the POL.

General Taylor in a major memo
to the President discusses the
problem of negotiations des-
cribing the bombing and other
US military actions as "blue
chips" to be bargained away at
the negotiation table not given
away as a precondition before-
hand.

Bundy, commenting on Taylor's
"blue chip" memo takes a harder
position on what we should get
for a bombing halt -- i.e. both
an end of infiltration and a
cessation of VC/NVA military
activity in the South.

Rostow urges the attack on POL
based on the results such
attacks produced against Germany
in W.W. Il.
