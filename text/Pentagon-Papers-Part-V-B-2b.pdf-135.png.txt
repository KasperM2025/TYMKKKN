5. Draft Statenent of NSC Policy. It was pointed out that
this policy “gtatenents is now before the Joint Chiefs of Stafr and
he Joint Secretaries within the Department of Defense. The neet-
ing todsy specifically did not consider the question of a commitment
£ U.S. arned forces since that question is beyond its authority and-

ae the draft statenent contains a policy statement on this question.
It was the consensv’s of the meeting thet the draft policy statement

i is quite adequate, even in the light of the deteriorating nilitary
situation which had been anticipated in the formulation of this draft
statement. The meeting felt that the nub of the Indochina problem
is this —- "Can the French stabilises the military situation long
enough to increase their troop strength sufficiently to match and

overcone the rapidly growing manpower superiority of the Viet Ninh?"
Accordingly, the increase in available manpower is the primary need
in Indochina, The draft statement ee ase policy addresses itself

mainly to this problem. It was Nr. Iacy's opinion that this policy

statement should be processed just as rapidly 2s possible.

’ 6: General Nalony emphasized the Svea ey increased import ance
of the forthcoming military staff talks with the French in the Far
East; they may generate an invigorated determination to take the
‘necessary measures to hold Indochina within the free world. The
meeting felt that these talks should concentrate on Indochina and

be held 2s sson as possible, Accordingly, it is necessary to obtain
NSC consideration of Indochina chastiy. -
