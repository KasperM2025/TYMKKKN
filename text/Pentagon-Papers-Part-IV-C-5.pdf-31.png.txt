11 June JCS 1123472 JCS told Sharp that somewhat
less than MACV's 19118 was close
to being approved as an alterna-
tive. Force described amounted to
one additional Army brigade instead
of the airmobile division. JCS
wanted to know where Westmoreland
would put the brigade were it to be
approved.

13 June MACV 131515z Westmoreland objected to Taylor's
questioning of the seriousness of
the situation and pointed out that
to date ARVN had lost 5 battalions
and the end was not in sight. He
justified his request for troops by
Corps area and asked for a free hand
in maneuvering units. He included
his concept for the employment of
ROK and ARVN troops. :

15 June McNamara gave the green light for
planning to deploy the airmobile
division to SVN by 1 September.

16 June Press McNamara announced deployments to
Conference SVN that would bring U.S. strength

there to between 70,000 and 75,000
men. 20,000 of these would be com-
bat troops and more would be sent
if necessary. He said U.S. troops
were needed because the RVNAF to VC
force ratio of less than 4 to 1 was
too low to enable the GVN to cope
with the threat. Total U.S. Bns
after deployments would be 15.

17 June Embtel. 4220 Taylor confirmed to State the
seriousness of the military situa-
tion in SVN. GVN had to either
give up outlying outposts or face -

â€˜being ambushed trying to reinforce -
them.
18 June White House McGeorge Bundy passed on to McNamara
