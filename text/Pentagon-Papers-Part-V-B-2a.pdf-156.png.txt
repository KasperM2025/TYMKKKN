Their expectation is that Indochinese political groups,
with their rivalries and easy realignments, will provide

many Of Ho's followers and possibly Ho himself. They would
expect to be in a position to intervene, with the Communist
menace as a pretext, if a decisive Red coup took place;
moreover, they would probably attempt to take some steps
toward intervention immediately (especially in Tonkin) if a
Communist coup took place in France (this threat has, of
course, diminished recently). Finally, if the Chinese
Government itself is further weakened or possibly driven
southward, the Chinese may not impossibly feel that the

US will not in its own interests allow such a strategic
area to fall to Communism and will necessarily come to

the rescue.
