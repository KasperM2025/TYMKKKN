This, it turned out, was the main reeson for the previous discrepancies
in MACV and U.S, mission evaluations of the war. In the first flush of
self-satisfaction after the coup, Loige had predicted that the change
of regime would shorten the war because of the improved morale of the
ARV troops. 42/ But as time wore on, the accumulating evidence of
the gravity of the military situation displaced these sanguine prog-
noses.

_The only comforting note in the intelligence was the apparent dis-
confiture of the National Liberation Front. ‘Throughout the summer and
fall, the NLP had seemingly been uneble to capitalize on the Buddhist
or student struggle movements. In fect, its principal response to the
Diem-Buddhist clash had been increasingly vituperative attacks cn the
U.S. Hot until November 7th did the ULF issue a post-Diem policy state~
ment, consisting of a list of “eight demands": 43/

(1) Destroy all strategic hamlets...and other disguised camps.
(2) Release all political detainees....
(3) Promulgate without delay democratic freedom....

(4) Root out all vestiges of the fascist and militerist dic-
tatorial regime.

2 (5) Stop all persecution and repression and raiding operations.
(6) Dissolve all nepotist organizations....
(7) “immediately stop forcible conscription....
(8) Cancel all kinds of unjustified taxes.
The Duong Van Minh government could claim that it was in the process of
meeting all of these "demands" except one -~ halting the draft -- so that
the NLP was effectively pre-empted. On November 17, the NLF Central
Committee issued another series of demands:
(1) Eliminate the vestiges of the Diem regime.
(2) stablish democratic freedom.
(3) Eliminate American influence.
) (4) Make social and economic reforms.

) (5) Halt the fighting.

(6) Establish a coalition government.
