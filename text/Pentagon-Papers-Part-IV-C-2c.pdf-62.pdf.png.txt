this purpose. Rostow urged trying "to gear this whole operation with
the best counterinsurgency effort we can mount with our Vietnamese
friends...and not withdray U.S. forces from Viet Nam until the wer is

In closing, Rostow outlined a scenario of action that would
follow from the kind of Presidential decision described above. This
would include, in sequence:

(1) â€˜Immediate movement of relevant forces to the Pacific.

(2) Immediate direct communication to Hanoi. -- including
a clear statement of the limits of our objectives
but our absolute commitment to then.

(3) Should this first communication fail (as is likely)
installation of our ground forces and navel blockade,
plus first attack in North, to be accompanied by _
publication [of a report on infiltration/ and Presi-
dential speech, 111/

Thus, in their communications to senior officials in the letter half of
November, both Walt Rostow and the JCS stressed a similar point. Al-
though edvocating different solutions, they both emphasized that the
Administration could not expect to dissuade Hanoi and Peking from con-
tinued pursuit of the DRV's important and strongly-held commitments
without meking correspondingly strong commitments to resist them. The
JCS, for their ow reasons, sought to avoid a commitment of ground
forces to Vietnem end argued instead for punitive air and naval actions.
Rostow felt that by forceful and meaningful demonstrations of national
resolve, including the commitment of ground forces to South Vietnan,
direct use of force against the Communist nations need be minimal.
