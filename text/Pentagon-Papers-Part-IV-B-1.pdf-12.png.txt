compelled to do something to restore
confidence, demonstrate U.S. resolve

20 Jan 1961 President Kennedy
Inaugurated

28 Jan 1961 Kennedy Approves the Gredually developed during 1961, the
Counterinsurgency CIP was to be the basis for expanded
Plan (CIP) for Viet- U.S. assistance to Vietnam. Kennedy
nam autometically approved its main pro-

visions; negotiations with Diem about
the CIP begen 13 February and con-
tinued through May of 1961. The U.S.
offered $28.4 million to support a
20,000-man increase in the ARVN (for
a new total of 170,000); to train,
equip and supply a 32,000-men Civil
Guard at $12.7 million. The full
package added less than $42 million
to the current $220 million aid pro-

gram.

The CIP called for consolidation of
the RVNAF chain of command (never
fully accomplished under Diem.) Na
agreement was reached on the question
of strategy during this period.

(Diem wanted "strategic" outposts,
Agrovilles, lines of strength through-
out the country; the MAAG favored 4
"net and spear" concept -- small units
operating out of pacified areas to
find the enemy, call in reserve forces,
gradually extend security to all of
Vietnam. )

Civil reforms included urging Diem to
broaden his government, include oppo-
sition political leaders in the
cabinet, give the National Assembly
some power, institute civic action to
win hearts, minds and loyalty of the
peasants.
