POL deferred

JCS msg 5311

Admiral Sharp again urges the
authorization of POL attacks.

General Westmoreland supports
CINCPAC's request for strikes
on the POL system.

The President, having decided
sometime at the end of May to
approve the POL attacks, informs
UK FM Wilson. Wilson urges

the President to reconsider.

Rusk, travelling in Europe,
urges the President to defer
the POL decision because of the
forthcoming visit of Canadian
Ambassador Ronning to Hanoi and
the possibility of some peace
feeler.

"It is estimated that the
neutralization of the bulk
petroleum storage facilities

in NVN will not in itself pre-
clude Hanoi's continued support
of essential war activities."

Having been informed of high
level consideration of the POL
strikes by McNamara, CINCPAC
assures they will cause under
50 civilian casualties.

Canadian Ambassador Ronning
goes to Hanoi and confers with
top DRV leaders. He returns
with no message or indication
of DRV interest in talks.

CINCPAC is ordered to strike the
POL at first light on 24 June.

Bad weather forces rescheduling
of the strikes for 25 June.

The POL execute order is res-
einded because of a press leak.
