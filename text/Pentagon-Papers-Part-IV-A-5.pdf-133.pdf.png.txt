In spite of the fact that the bastard regime created and
protected by colonialism has been overthrown and that many of
the feudal organizations of factions and parties which oppress
the population were destroyed, the people do not know a better
life or more freedom under the republican regime which you
have created. A constitution has been established in form
only; a National Assembly exists whose deliberations always
fall into line with the government; antidemocratic elections
-- all those are methods and "comedies" copied from the
dictatorial Communist regimes, which obviously cannot serve
as terms of comparison with North Viet Nam.

Continuous arrests fill the jails and prisons to the
rafters, as at this precise moment; public opinion and the
press are reduced to silence, The same applies to the popular
will as translated in certain open elections, in which it is
insulted and trampled (as was the case, for example, during
the recent elections for the Second Legislature). All these
have provoked the discouragement and resentment of the people.

Political parties and religious sects have been eliminated,
"Groups" or "movements" have replaced them, But this substi-
tution has only brought about new oppressions against the
population without protecting it for that matter against Com-
munist enterprises, Here is one example: the fiefs of reli-
gious sects, which hitherto were deadly for the Communists,
now not only provide no security whatever but have become
favored highways for Viet Minh guerrillas, as is, by the way,
the case of the rest of the country.

This is proof that the religious sects, though futile,
nevertheless constitute effective anti-Communist elements,
Their elimination has opened the way to the Viet Cong and
unintentionally has prepared the way for the enemy, whereas
a more realistic and more flexible policy could have amal-
gamated them all with a view to reinforcing the anti-Communist
front.

Today the people want freedom, You should, Mr, President,
liberalize the regime, promote democracy, guarantee minimum
civil rights, recognize the opposition so as to permit the
citizens to express themselves without fear, thus removing
grievances and resentments, opposition to which now consti-
tutes for the people their sole reason for existence. When
