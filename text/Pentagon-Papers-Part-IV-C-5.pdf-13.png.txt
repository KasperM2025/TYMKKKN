In June, Rolling Thunder and the ground strategy switched places in
the order of priorities as far as achieving U.S. objectives was concerned.
First, a positive strategy for the employment of the forces, the search
and destroy strategy, was approved. Secondly, a force of 44 battalions
was recognized as sufficient to prevent collapse while the stage was being
set for further deployments. 4 battalions was probably about the maxi-
mum.the traffic would have borne at that juncture in any case. Final
acceptance of the desirability of inflicting defeat on the enemy rather
than merely denying him victory opened the door to an indeterminate amount
of additional force.

The 44 battalions, or Phase I as they were later called, were sup-
posed to stem the tide of the Viet Cong insurgency and enable the friendly
forces to assume the offensive. As the GVN did not collapse, it can
reasonably be concluded that they did stem the tide. It is just possible,
however, that rather than stem the tide, they increased it through pro-
vocation of greater infiltration from North Vietnam. In any case, it is

debatable whether the allied forces actually did assume the offensive the
following year.

No further proof of the monumental implications of the endorsement
in the summer of 1965 of the search and destroy strategy, the 44 battalions,
and the "win" concept is required beyond the present state of the war in
. Vietnam. At this writing, the U.S. has reached the end of the time frame
estimated by General Westmoreland in 1965 to be required to defeat the
eneny. It has committed 107 battalions of its own forces and a grand
total of 525,000 men. The strategy remains search and destroy, but vic-
tory is not yet in sight.
