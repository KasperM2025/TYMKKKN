her to pay almost the full cost by maintaining her repairâ€™
erews in place. The sorties diverted from Zones 6A and 6B
could be concentrated on the infiltration routes in Zones 1
and 2 (the southern end of North Vietnam, including the

Mu Gia Pass), in Laos and in South Vietnam. /

a/ Any limitation on the bombing of North Vietnam will cause
serious psychological problems among the men who are risking
their lives to help achieve our political objectives; among
their commanders up to and including the JCS; and among those
of our people who cannot understand why we should withhold
punishment from the enemy. General Westmoreland, as do the
JCS, strongly believes in the military value of the bombing

The Secretary's footnote was judicious. The Chiefs did
indeed oppose any curtailment of the bombing as a means to get negoti-

With respect to the bombing program per se they stated:

The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not concur in your recom-
mendation that there should be no increase in level of
pombing effort and no modification in areas and targets subject

The Joint Chiefs of Staff do not coneur with your pro-
posal that, as a carrot to induce negotiations, we should
suspend or reduce our bombing campaign against NVN. Our
experiences with pauses in bombing and resumption have not
been happy ones. Additionally, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
believe that the likelihood of the war being settled by
negotiation is small, and that, far from inducing negoti-
ations, another bombing pause will be regarded by North
Vietnamese leaders, and our Allies, as renewed evidence
of lack of US determination to press the war to a successful
