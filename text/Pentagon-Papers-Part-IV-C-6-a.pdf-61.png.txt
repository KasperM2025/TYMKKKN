(3) Case 1:

(a) Generally adequate when measured against CINCPAC
objectives and capabilities except that there is
a continuing deficiency in helicopter mobility. 49/

Having received CINCPAC's requirement, the Secretary of Defense
directed a series of studies to identify and evaluate the options which
appeared to be open. The scope of these studies is indicated by a
partial listing of projects compiled by Assistant Secretary for Man-
power, Thomas D. Morris:

Views on Army and Marine Corps PACOM reserve forces;
Acceptable draw-down on Europe;
Recommendations on use of third country forces;

Posture paper on strategic reserves and reconstitution
of draw-downs;

Analyze rotation base requirements;

Study possibilities for further expansion of Army
training base;

Recommend temporary draw-downs on Army CONUS and over-
seas forces to support deployments, activations and
training-rotation base;

Evaluate use of resources of Army temporary forces
(9th Division and 2 add-on brigades) to meet other
MACV requirements. ... 50

One key question asked was the latest date at which a decision on
use of reserves must be made. 51,/

Part of the answer -~- the dates by which reserves would have to be
called in lieu of forming the 9th Division and the 198th Brigade -- was
15 June for the brigade and 26 June for the division. 52/

With this time to work in, the Secretary of Defense directed the

-.-Military Departments and the JCS to assume that this
[the Case i deployment schedule/ is the requirement we will
try to meet, to study all possible ways of meeting it short
of calling reserves or extending terms of service, and until
further notice, in so far as possible, to plan to deploy
forces to SVN on this schedule (forces to other SEA areas
