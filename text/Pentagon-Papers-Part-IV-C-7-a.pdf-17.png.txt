The President invites Ho to
indicate what reciprocity he
might expect from a bombing
halt. The letter is trans-
mitted in Moscow Feb. 8.

While this truce was in effect

frantic efforts were undertaken
by UK PM Wilson and Premier
Kosygin in London to get peace
talks started. In the end
these failed because the enor-
mous DRV resupply effort forces
the President to resume the
bombing after having first
extended the pause.

Replying to the President's
letter, Ho rejects the US
conditions and reiterates that
unconditional cessation of the
bombing must precede any talks.

Amb. Thompson indicates the
Soviets would react extremely
adversely to the mining of
Haiphong.

Vance sends Katzenbach a package
of proposals for the President's
night reading. Bight categories
of new targets are analyzed;
none can seriously undercut the
flow of supplies South.

Bundy notes that mining of the
waterways and coastal areas of
the DRV panhandle could be
approved without the mining of
Haiphong.

Taylor again considers the
question of ceasefire, polit-
ical settlement and sequencing
of agreements. No direct
bearing on the situation.
