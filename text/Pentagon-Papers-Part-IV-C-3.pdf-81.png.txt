Some of these JCS recommendations were quickly accepted, particu-
larly those having to do with Air Force deployments. Thus the Adminis-
tration approved the dispatch, from 11 to 13 February, of 30 B-52's to
Guam and 30 KC-135's to Okinawa. Designated Arc Light, these bombers
and tankers of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) initielly were earmarked.
(though never used) for high-altitude, all-weather bombing of important
targets in the North.- 61/

The particular JCS air strike program, on the other hand, was never
adopted. The detailed JCS target proposals did figure prominently in
the intensive highest-level reprisal and pressures planning that con-
tinued during the succeeding weeks and months, but that planning was
conducted essentially on an ad hoc basis, strike by strike, and did not
at this stage embrace a multi-week program.
