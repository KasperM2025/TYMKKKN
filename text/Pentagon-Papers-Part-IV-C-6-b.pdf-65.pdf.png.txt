CINCPAC 0120052 February 1967, to JCS, Subj: "Closing NVN Ports”

Ibid. CINCPAC 1822107 January 1967 requested authorization to hit
25 “selected lucrative targets in Haiphong” as a package. Essen-
tially the same reasons were outlined in the January message. See
Note 32, p. 28. i

CINCPAC 0608202 February 1967 to JCS, Subj: "Barrier Plan." It
may be helpful to trace the discussion and planning leading to this
document. JCS 0619Z January 1967 initiated COMUSMACV-CINCPAC
detailed planning to support the barrier concept, according to
criteria and guidance contained in the DCRG Memorandum for the
Secretary of Defense, Subj: "Plan for Increased Anti-Infiltration
Capability for SEA," dated 22 December 1966. On 11 and 17 January
CINCPAC directed COMUSMACV to submit an overall plan. (CINCPAC
112347Z January 1967 and 170051% January 1967). COMUSMACV PRACTICE
NINE Requirement Plans, 26 January 1967, was submitted in response
to the CINCPAC order. ~The CINCPAC cable on 25 January seems an
attempt to balance the barrier concept in light of COMUSMACV's
requirements plan, and to present some anti-infiltration alterna-
tives to PRACTICE NINE. The message being discussed tried to tie
all of the proposals together.

Ibid. The general. rejection of the concept implied in the opening

paragraph probably refers to only the eastern sector, although it
may be interpreted as a more sweeping denial.
