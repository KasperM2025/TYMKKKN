State msg 1786 to Lodge

The Chiefs propose a systematic
air attack on the NVN POL
storage and distribution net-
work.

General Carroll (Dir. DIA)
gives an appraisal of the
bombing with few bright spots.

McNamara and General Wheeler
make a hurried trip to Vietnam
to consider force increases.

Among other parts of the
report, McNamara urges a pause
in the bombing to prepare the
American public for future
escalations and to give Hanoi
a last chance to save face.

Bundy summarizes the pros and
cons with respect to a pause
and concludes against it.

McNaughton favors a "hard-line"
pause with resumption unless
the DRV stopped infiltration
and direction of the war, with-
drew infiltrators, made the VC
stop attacks and stopped inter-
fering with the GVN's exercise
of its functions.

Rusk having apparently been
convinced, this new draft by
Bundy and Johnson recommends

a pause.

McNamara states that he is
giving consideration to the
JCS proposal for attacking the
NVN POL system.

The bombing pause begins. It

lasts for 37 days until the
31st of January.
