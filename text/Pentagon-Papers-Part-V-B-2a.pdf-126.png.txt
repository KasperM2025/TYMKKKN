Bonnet said that he had little direct info with
regard to the present situation in Indochina but referred
to Leon Blum's speech in the- Assembly this morning. He
summarized important points of the speech which he
said clearly indicated that Blum's policy is to settle
the question as far as.ipossible by conciliatory means
and that this was the purpose of Mouvet's visit. He
said that Blum had reiterated that French policy is.to
assure the independence (within the French empire) of
Viet Nam and complete self GOVT. It was unfortunate
that it had been impossible up to the present to imple-
ment the far reaching concessions embodied in the
French agreement with Viet Nam. ;

le said that personally he would be surprised if
the Chinese brought the question up before the Security
Council at this time for he felt that the Nanking GOVT
was sympathetic to the French position in Indochina.
He concluded by saying that he would inform his Gov?
of our friendly interest and of our deep concern over
the situation and let us know the reaction from Paris.
