removes the civilian government and
puts him in power.

The Diem coup and the subsequent
political instability in the fall of
1963 are given by MACV as the main
reasons for the rise in VC activity
and the decline in GVN control of the
country. The tempo of GVN operations
was good but the effectiveness low.
Military failures were largely attri-
buted to political problems.

The preliminary report of the special
CAS group cross-checking the report-
ing system confirms the deterioration
of the strategic hamlet program. It
documents the decline in rural security
and the increase in VC attacks.

-This intelligence community evaluation

of the short-term prospects for Viet-
nem confirms the pessimism now felt in
all quarters. The political insta-
bility is the hard core problen.

The final CAS group report confirms
the black picture of its initial esti-
mate in greater detail and further
confirms the previous failings of the
reporting system.

In addition to a long list of recom-
mendations for GVN action, the JCS
propose to SecDef major US escalatory
steps including bombing of the North.

General Harkins takes issue not with
the specific factusl reporting of the
CAS Group, but with their broader
conclusions about the direction the
war is going, and the respective
effectiveness of the VC and GV.

The JCS outline their proposal for
punitive action against the DRY to
halt Northern support for the Vo in-
surgency. Bombing is specifically
called for.
