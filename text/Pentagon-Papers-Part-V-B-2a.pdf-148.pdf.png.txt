under current French policy, which is maing position of

without participation of Ho Chi Minh, as Ho and his group

are the only ones having a genuinely popular following.

unlikely of success. Persistence of French in present military
course carries danger of forcing entire freedom movement into
hands of Extreme, Communist elements.

Ho is regarded as Communist but many Vietminh leaders are not.
Vice Minister is impressed with Ho's personality and com-

Communist-influenced regime adjacent to her southern border
did not appear to be of critical importance.

The National Union Front does not have a solid popular base.
It consists in the main of a group of prominent figures and

assassinations in Saigon and Hanoi were recalled) the move-
