DULTE 5 from Paris, 21 Oct 54 (TS). Robert Shaplen, op.cit., p. 118,
reports these comments by Kenneth Young: “We realized we had to
proceed carefully with the French, so when they made clear their
position on Diem, we sent a cable to Senator Mansfield, of the Foreign
Relations Committee, who was sbroad, asking him what he thought of Diem
as Premier, Mansfield was an old friend of Diem's and we knew what
the answer would be in advance, of course, but it stwuoned the French.
While they then dropped their open campaign to dump Diem, it became
apparent that they were still maneuvering behind the scenes toward

the same objective, and we realized that while we still had to work
with the French in Vietnam, we would have to adopt a more independent
position." .
