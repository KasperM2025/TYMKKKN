II. CONSOLIDATION AND EXTENSION OF GVN CONTROL

Pacification. Based on available reports of questionable validity,
the table on the following page indicates the various degrees of GVN and
VC/NVA population and hamlet control. In the 14 months between July 31,
1965 and September 30, 1966, the GVM reportedly gained control of an addi-
tional 1,5 000 people, raising its control of the total SV population

from 47% to 55% - the hishest level to date. During the same period VC/NVA
control of the total pooulation decreased &%, a loss of 8090 ,0GO peoole. GVN
control of the rural population rose from 23% to 35%, while vce/NVA rural
control fell from 35% to 28% during the same period.

It is highly likely that these figures are grossly ontimistic. It should
be noted that about 30% of the reported gains provably came from movement of
refugees into cities and towns. Another report indicates that GVN increased
its control of area only from 8% to 12% in 1966 through September. Since 1965
the VC/NVA have claimed control of 80% of the SVN territory ant 75% of the
population. At the end of September 1966, the GVN controlled about 25% of
the vital roads in SVII. It controlled about 20% of the total roads, down
from 35% in 1965 and 4o% in 1964. The rest were marginal or closed and could

be traveled only with adequate security precautions.

The pacification program has been stalled for years; it is stalled
today. The situation in this regard is no better = possibly worse - than

it was in 1965, 1963 and 1061, ‘The large unit war, at which we are suc-
ceeding fairly well, is largely irrelevant 40 pacification as long as we
keep the regular VC/NVA units from inberfering and do-not lose the major
battles.
