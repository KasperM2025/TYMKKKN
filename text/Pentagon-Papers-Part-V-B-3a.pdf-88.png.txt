sentiment that will allow them to face local difficulties
as soon as possible. Complete withdrawal of the French -

was very proud of his Korean army but said that if the
U.S. left Korea it would all disappear. Therefore, he
wished to maintain the U.S. effort in Korea just like
the French in Indochina. [It is true that the Laotian
affair involves a singular aggravation. An operational
plan had been given to the Pentagon, including certain
inevitable risks. Within 2-1/2 years, as President
Eisenhower has said, it would allow us to arrive at

essentially based on the development of national armies.
It requires for its solution finances, cadres and rapid
training of units.

The French missions which have been received in Korea

question of clubs, the problem has never arisen in Indo-
china as in other colonies because there has always
been close touch between local and French families. The
problem arises even less now that there is a Vietnamese
