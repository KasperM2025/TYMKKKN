"]. We should certainly stress that the war is essentially
a_ Vietnamese responsibility, and this we have repeatedly done,
particularly in our announced policy on U.S. troop withdrawal.
At the same time we cannot disengage U.S. prestige to any sig-
nificant degree....

"2. The security situation is serious, but we can still win,

WR --.-Any deal either to divide the present territory of

south Vietnam or to 'neutralize' South Vietnam would inevitably
mean a new government in Saigon that would in short order become
Communist-dominated.

"hk, The consequences of a Communist-dominated South Vietnam
are extremely serious both for the rest of Southeast Asia and
for the U.S. position in the rest of Asia and indeed in other
key areas of the world....

"5. Thus, the stakes in preserving an anti-Communist South

"I still am hopeful of doing that. We did, of course, bring
back 1,000 men toward the latter part of last year. I am hopeful
we can bring back additional numbers of men later this year and
certainly next year. I say this because I personally believe
that this is a war that the Vietnamese must fight...I don't believe
we can take on that combat task for them. Ido believe we can ~

"But after all, the training, by the very nature of the work,
comes to an end at a certain point. We will have started this
expanded training and carried it out for a period of 4 years, by
the end of next year. We started at the end of 1961. The end
of next.year will have been 4 years later and certainly we should
