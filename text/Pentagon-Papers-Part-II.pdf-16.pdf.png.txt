But a contemporary Vietnamese critic took a quite different view:

"All these conventions conserve in Indochina a privileged
position for French capital, supported by the presence of a
powerful fleet and army. Even if no one talks any more of an
Indochinese Federation, it is still a federalism both adminis-
trative and economic (Monetary Union, Customs Union, Communica-
tions Union, etc.) which co-ordinates the various activities of
the three Associated States. France always exercises control
through the representatives she has in all the organs of planning
or of federal surveillance, and through what is in effect the
right of veto, because the president or the secretary general of
these committees is always elected by joint decision of the four
governments and, further, because most of the decisions of the
committees are made by unanimous agreement."

Bao Dai's delegates were, however, generally pleased with the outcome of
Pau. His Prime Minister, Tran Van Huu declared as he signed the conven-
tions that "our independence is now perfect." But to the ordinary
Vietnamese, to honest Frenchmen, and to the Americans, Tran Van Huu was
proved dramatically wrong.
