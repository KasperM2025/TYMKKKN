Pike, op. cit., 82, quoting a Radio Hanoi broadcast of June 5, 1964.
A CIA agent in 1956 reported that Southern Party organizations had
been directed to merge with the Fatherland Front, CIA, Singapore,
Cs-82270, 16 January 1956.

Cf., Kahin and Lewis, op. cit., 113-116. Also: "New National Front
Formed in S. Vietnam," Foreign Broadcast Information Service Bulletin,
31 January 1961, pp. EEE 13-17. On 2 February 1961 (ibid., 2 Feb,

EE 5), Radio Hanoi. elaborated: "The French language paper LA DEPECHE
DU CAMBODGE [ot Phnom Penh, Cambodia/ . . . on 24 December announced
that it had received the manifesto of the front which said that it had
come into existence to meet the aspiration of the South Vietnamese
people, and that it undertook to liberate them from My-Diem slavery."
[fhe same paper quoted REUTERS, report dated 24 December/ "the front
may have intensified its political activities in the countryside and
among the South Vietnamese armed forces ..." The U.S. Department
of State, however, has taken the view that the NLF was formed in
Hanoi; cf., the "White Papers" of 1961 and 1965, op. cit., and Letter,
Under Secretary Katzenbach to Congressman Evans, 5 March 1968.

Biographical information on 73 of the leaders and key cadre of the
NLF and affiliated organizations indicates that 66% (48) of this group
were born in South Vietnam, and that an additional 8 are probably
Southerners. Only 2 of the 73 were certainly born in the North,

while an additional 2 may have been born there. (The birthplace of

13 of the 73 is unknown.) It can also be ascertained from the bio-
graphical data that at least 60 of the 73 are highly educated,
particularly so by Asian standards. Tbid.
