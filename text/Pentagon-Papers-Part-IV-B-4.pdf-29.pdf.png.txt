Since the ultimate objective of the CPSVN was early withdrawal of
U.S. special military assistance, the plan provided for phasing out U.S.
advisory forces. The affected major commands of USMACV that would largely
not be required after FY 66 were:

1. The U.S. Marine Element which provided helicopter trans-
portation support.

2. The 2d Air Division which provided the USAF portion of the
special military assistance support performed in SVN. This
support included "Farmgate" (Fighter), "Mule Train" (Trans-
portation), and "Able Mable" (Reconnaissance). It also
provided USAF administration and logistical support for USAF
personnel and equipment engaged in special military assistance
to SVN.

3- U.S. Army Support Group Vietnam (USASGY) which provided the
U.S. Army portion of the special military assistance support
for SVN (except that performed by MAAG and Headquarters MACY) ,
including helicopter and fixed wing air transportetion, signal
communications, and special forces. It also provided U.S.
administrative and logistical support for assigned and attached
personnel and equipment engaged in the special military assistance.

4, Headquarters Support Activity Saigon (HSAS) which provided
administrative support to the U.S. Headquarters and other U.S.
government sponsored agencies and activities located in Saigon.

9+ MAAG Vietnam would have its strength reduced by One-half after
FY 65. Only 1,500 MAAG personnel were to remain in country
after FY 6.
