by the end of 1964. â€˜The Delta will teke longer but
should be completed by the end-of 1965. But for
these predictions to be valid, certain conditions
must be met. Your government should be prepared to
energize all agencies, military end civil, to a
higher owtput of activity than up to now. Ineffec-

replaced as soon as identified. Finally, there

restoring peace to your country. 9.

very well?" To this the SecDef's response was:

Secretary Mcllamara. Yes we do. I think Gen. Taylor has
emphasized and 1 would like to emphasize again, that while
we believe the serious political unrest has not to date
seriously and adversely affected the military effort, it
may do so in the future, if it continues.

Chairman Morgan. General, or Mr. Secretary, could we say
that the military situation is moving well, but the political
situation is not - the political situation is bad?

Secretary McNamara. Yes, I think that is a fair summary.
Chairman Morgan. Mr. Secretary, then, from your observations ,
