Marks (Dir., USIA) memo to
Rusk

JCSM 59-67

McNaughton "Scenario"

we

Westmoreland opposes the Tet
truce based on VC violations of
the two truces just completed.

CINCPAC endorses Westmoreland's
opposition to the Tet truce.

The Chiefs note the heavy DRV
resupply during the two truces
and oppose the proposed 96-hour
Tet truce.

The Chiefs renew their opposi-
tion to the Tet truce.

Admiral Sharp recommends six
priority targets for RT in 1967:
(1) electric power, (2) the
industrial plant, (3) the trans-
portation system in depth, (4)
military complexes, (5) POL,

(6) Haiphong and the other ports.

Sharp again urges the attack
of Haiphong and an intensified
overall campaign.

No new target categories are
approved.

Keeping up his barrage of
cables, Sharp urges the closing
of the NVN ports by aerial mining.

Marks proposes extending the
Tet truce for 12 to 24 hours in
an effort to get negotiations
started.

The Chiefs propose the mining of
selected inland waterways and
selected coastal areas to inhibit
internal sea transportation in
NVN.

A handwritten "Scenario" for the
pause by McNaughton which notes
MeNamara's approval calls for
extension of the Tet truce to

7 days to get negotiations starte:
