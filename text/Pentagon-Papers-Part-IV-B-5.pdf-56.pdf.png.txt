United States acquiesce in what the Nhus had done," was given great
weight, 19/ Admiral Felt telephoned Washington from CINCPAC to support
a strong U.S, stand against the Nhus, 20/ The unanswered question, of
course, was whether the Nhus could be removed without also sacrificing
Diem, and if not, whether the resulting political instebility would not
have an even more detrimental effect on the war effort than maintaining
Diem,

The August 24 cable of instructions to Lodge resulting from these
deliberations outlined an important, and subsequently controversial, new
policy approach for the U.S. in South Vietnam. Its opening paragraphs
crisply set forth the new American view:

It is now clear that whether military proposed martial
â€œlaw or whether Nhu tricked them into it, Nhu took advantage

prepared to accept the obvious implication that we can no
longer support Diem. You may also tell appropriate military
commanders we will give them direct support in any interim
period of breakdown central government mechanism. 22/

Finally, the message recognized the need to publicly exonerate the army
from the raids and asked Lodge to approve a VOA broadcast to that effect.
Lodge was requested, as well, to survey urgently for alternative leader-
ship.

Clearance of the draft message was complicated by the coincident
week-end absence from Washington of most of the top level members of
the Administration, The President was in Hyannis Port; Rusk was in
New York; and McNamara and McCone were away on vacation. Both the
