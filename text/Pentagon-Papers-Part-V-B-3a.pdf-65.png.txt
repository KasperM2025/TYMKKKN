ing of Vietnamese national levies has been examined from
time to time. Conclusion reached generally negative be-
cause of language problem and also because of French
sensitivities.

Question of whether US could assist French in “tron _|

Nevertheless, it seems to us that French, Viets, ROKS
and ourselves could profit from exchange of experience in |
this field.

I should therefore appreciate your view as to the {
possibility of arranging for exchange of missions between
Korea and IC. Mission from IC could consist of French
officers engaged in training national armies plus Viet,
Cambodian and Laotian officer. Mission from Korea could
consist of US officers plus one or more ROK officers.

Idea would be that mission could examine training practices
in other country with view to taking advantage useful
features of experience in that country. Possibly after
visits completed, two missions might have conference for
purpose comparing notes and perhaps reaching certain con-
clusions or formulating recommendations.

If you think this idea presents possibilities, sug-
gest you discuss it on informal and personal basis with
Letourneau, Salan and perhaps Allard, and if they concur,
with appropriate Vietnamese officials. Similarly, explora-
tion will probably be conducted simultaneously with US and
ROK officials in Korea.

We believe that carrying out of this exchange of
training missions might produce not only concrete advantages
