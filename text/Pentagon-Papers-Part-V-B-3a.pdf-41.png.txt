ject to agreement, the U.S. contemplates $100 million

223. Senator Mansfield states his conclusions based on
General Collins' analysis of the Vietnam situation:
(1) prospects for Diem "look very dim,” elections in
1956 would probably favor the communists; (2) the U.S.
should continue to support Vietnam as long as possible;
(3) he sees no alternative to Diem; (4) he is certain
refugees, Catholic bishops and church officials would
oppose replacement of Diem; (5) Paris should urge
Bao Dai cease his interference and support Diem; (6)
and Diem should be encouraged to compromise on issues.

225. Diem "passes the buck" of convincing the sect leaders
not to oppose the appointment of Dr. Quat as Defense
Minister to the U.S, Collins is convinced that Diem
and his brothers,Luyen and Nhu, are afraid of Quat
or any strong man in control of the armed forces
since with "spineless General Ty" as Chief of Staff,
Diem has effectively seized control of the army.
Further, Collins comments on the alternatives to Diem
Government; though the alternative of gradual with-
drawal from Vietnam "is least desirable, in all honesty,
and in view of whet I have observed here to date it is

+ possible this may be the only sound solution." Collins
