on
UNITED STATES OBJECTIVES AND COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT
LO SOQULHEAST ASIA*

4, To prevent the countries of Southeast Asia from
passing into the communist orbit, and to assist them to
develop the will and ability to resist communism from within
and without and to contribute to the strengthening of the

free world.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

2. Communist domination, by whatever eeu. of all
Southeast Asia would seriously endanger in the short tera,
and critically endanger in the longer term, United States
security interests,

a. The loss of any of the countries of Southeast

Asia to communist control as a consequence of overt or

covert Chinese Communist aggression would have critical

psychological, political and economic consequences. In

the absence of effective and timely counteraction, the

loss of any single country would probably lead to

relatively swift submission to or an alignment with

communism by the remaining euunetses of this group.

Furthermore, an alignment with communi sit of the rest of
Southeast Asia is used herein ie ean oe embracing

e area
Burma, Thailand, Indochina, Malaya 3 an 1onesia.
