8. General Navarre intends, during his current visit to France, a

to urgently request that the French Government authorize him the loan

_of the equivalent of at least 2 divisions from French forces outside

“Indochina. I In yew of the French conviction that they do not have

sufficient erees in Tadechine to win an Sele victory there, and the

: fact that the shipment of French divisions to Indochina would go far

toward convincing the fence-sitters that France can and will see this

war through to victory, I believe that the United States should support

General Navarre! ] request.

9. I can readily understand SHAPE's initial concern over the ship-

ment of. French divisions to Indochina. However, considering that these

divisions would be on loan only, that they would be returned at an early
date followed by the dividend of thousands of additional battle~hardened
and victorious French military veterans, and the great strength which

would accrue to France froma successful sottlement of the war in Indochina ,

I believe the action concerned would be to SHAPE's great advantage.

eG; Though the addition of 2 divisions, endowed with a divisional
concept of teamvork, ‘continuity ; impetus, and employment of artillery,
could provide the military balance 40 assure an early victory, I feel
that any addition other than in divisional soeanicattol would be in error
since it is the divisional Amy with its combat proven effectiveness,

which is sorely needed. in Indochina.
