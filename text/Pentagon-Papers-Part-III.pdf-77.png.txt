Geneva Conference Declarations of GVN

Continued
On Partition

"French, Soviet and Viet Minh
drafts all admit the principles
of a partition of Vietnam in two
zones, all of North Vietnam being
abandoned to the Viet Minh. Al-
though this partition is only pro-
visional in theory, it would not
(repeat not) fail to produce in
Vietnam the same effects as in
Germany, Austria, and Korea. It
would not bring the peace which is
sought for, deeply wounding the
national sentiment of the Viet-
namese people, it would provoke
trouble throughout the country,
trouble which would not fail to
threaten a peace so dearly ac- —
quired."

On Elections

"The Vietnemese Delegation there-
fore proposes:

1. A cease fire on present
positions.

2. Regroupment of troops in
two zones which would be
as small as possible.

3. Disarmament of irregular
troops.

4. After a period to be fixed,
disarmament of Viet Minh
troops and simultaneous
withdrawal of foreign troops.

5. Control ‘by the United Nations
A. Of the cease fire.
B. Of the regroupment.

C. Of the disarmament and
the withdrawal.

D. Of the administration
; of the entire country.

E. Of the general elections,
when the United Nations
believe that order and
security will have been .
everywhere truly restored.

This proposal made on the formal
instructions of His Majesty Bao
Dai, and of President Ngo Dinh
Diem, shows that the Chief of
State of Vietnam once more places
the independence and the unity of
his country above any other con-
siderations, and that the national
government of Vietnam would prefer
this provisional UN control over a
truly independent and United Viet-
nam to its maintenance in power in
a country dismembered and con-
demmed to slavery."
