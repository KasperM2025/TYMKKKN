notice to initiate the full range of Laotian and Cambodian
"Border Control" actions (beyond those authorized in paragraph
11 above) and the "Retaliatory Actions" against North Vietnam,
and to be in a position on 30 days' notice to initiate the j
program of "Graduated Overt Military Pressure" against North
Vietnam.

As for the future of the phased-withdrawal plans, the Secretary of
Defense's report contained the following:

"The U.S. policy of reducing existing personnel where South
Vietnamese are in a position to assume the functions is still sound.

future, but adherence to this policy as such has a sound effect in
portraying to the U.S. and the world that we continue to regard
the war as a conflict the South Vietnamese must win and take ultimate
responsibility for. Substantial reductions in the numbers of U.S.
military training personnel should be possible before the end of
1965. However, the U.S. should continue to reiterate that it will
provide all the assistance and advice required to do the job regard-
less of how long it takes." 61/
