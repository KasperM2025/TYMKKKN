The failure of the French to restore internal security
is attributed to the lack of cooperation on the majority
of the people in Indo-China and a deep-seated hatred
end distrust which exists amont a large part of the
population, A large measure of the distrust and non-
cooperative action on the part of the people has
undoubtedly been inspired by Communist propaganda and
the desire of the Oriental to "push the white man out

of Asia,!

Military action above can not solve the internal security
problem in Indo-China beaause of the lack of cooperation
on the part of the people, the distrust and hatred of

the French, and the effect of Communist activities and
propagenda, <A political solution, which includes con-
ecessions on the part of the French, and definite plans for
eventual independence of Viet Nam is a necessary com-
plement to military action.

‘The faliune to organize Viet Nam amned forces as a

separete entity and employ them as Vietnamese troops,
not as French Union troops, has been the source of
much dissatisfaction on the part of the people and
has created a considerable amount of distrust which
has withdrawn the support of many people from French
efforts,

The Viet Minh still controls the major portion of Indo-
China and, for all practical purposes, have the French
forces pinned to their occupied and garrisoned areas

to the extent that French movement is impossible through
partically all areas without armed escort.

The Viet Minh forces have steadily grown in strength
end improved their discipline and combat effectiveness,
Much of the succes in these fields can be attributed
to assistance and supplies from the Chinese Communists
end Communist propsganda.

A serious and dangerous external threat from Communist
China exists along the northern frontier,

The French forces disposed throughout Indo-China, with
‘their present equipment and organization, ere not capable
of dealing with the Vies Minh within the boarders of Indo-
China and resisting a strong Chinese Communist attack
from the north, The defenses along the frontier of Tonkin
