Â»-ethe bombing has not been very successful in
imposing economic losses on the North. Losses in domestic
production have been more than replaced by imports and the
availability of manpower, particularly because of the
natural growth in the labor force, has been adequate to
meet wartime needs. It is likely that North Vietnam
will continue to be able to meet extra manpower and
economic reguirements caused by the bombing short of
attacks on population centers or the cities. 62/

The paper itself examined two aspects of the problem:
the impact of the bombing on GNP and on labor supply/utilization. The
most telling part of the analysis was the demonstration that imports
had more than offset the cost of the war to the North in simple GNP
terms as the following passage shows:

TI. Effects on North Vietnam's Gross National Product

Prior to 1965, the growth rate of the North Viet-
namese economy averaged 6% per year. It is estimated that
this rate continued (and even increased slightly) during
1965 and 1966, the first two years of the bombing (Table 1).
In 1967, however, domestically~produced GNP declined
sharply to only $1,688 million -- a level roughly compar-
able to the prewar years of 1963 and 1964. The cumulative
less in GNP caused by the bombing in the last three years
is estimated to be $294 million (Table 2).

To offset these losses, North Vietnam has had an
increased flow of foreign economic aid. Prior to the
pombing, economic aid to North Vietnam averaged $95 million
annually. Since the bombing began, the flow of economic
aid has increased to $340 million per year (Table 1). The
cumulative increase in economic aid in the 1965-1967 period
over the 1953-1964 average has been an estimated $490 million.

Thus, over the entire period of the bombing, the
value of economic resources gained through foreign aid has
been greater than that lost because of the bombing (Table 3).
The cumulative foreign aid increase has been $490 million;
losses have totaled $294 million.

In addition to the loss of current production,
North Vietnam has lost an estimated $164 million in capital
assets destroyed by the bombing. These capital assets
include mach of North Vietnam's industrial base - its
manufacturing plants, power plants, and bridges.
