NO: 2567, May 12, 6 p.m.

Baeyens has informed me that French Government has authorized Bollaert
to approve formation provisional Vietnam government headed by Xuan but to
insist that seat of government be located at either Hanoi or Hue and not
at Saigon. Bollaert-Xuan negotiations will be conducted on basis Bay

of Along protocol which Xuan will countersign. Bao Dai will countersign
agreement reached with Xuan.

Baeyens stated Foreign Office was not optimistic as to extent popular
support provisional government could achieve and expressed hope that
representatives from Annam and Tonkin would be of sufficient stature to
offset at least in part government's being characterized as French puppet.

He had no information other than press report of early Bao Dai-Bollaert
meeting and Bao Dai's visit to Rurope Foreign Office endeavoring to block
latter which they consider could only lend support to charges of puppet
government.

â€œDepartment pass Saigon as No. 18.
