On 21 July, the day following the armistice agreements, the members of the
Geneva Conference approved a Final Declaration (by voice vote, with the
U.S. and GVN abstaining; a signed agreement was avoided in order not to
emphasize U.S. refusal to approve). The declaration is essentially a
comment on the armistice agreements, "taking note" and otherwise stressing
certain key points. A summary of the declaration follows:

(2) Summary of the Final Declaration

The Conference:

1. Takes note of cease-fire in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.
2, Expresses satisfaction in cease-fire agreements.
3. Takes note of planned 1955 elections in Cambodia and Laos.

kh. Takes note of prohibition of introduction of additional troops
and materiel into Vietnam, and of declarations of Cambodia and
Laos not to request foreign aid "except for the purpose of
effective defense of their territory."

5. Takes note of prohibition of foreign bases in Vietnam, and declara-
tions by Cambodia and Laos that they will not participate in any
military alliances "not in conformity with principles of the Charter
of the United Nations."

6. Recognizes the "essential purpose" of the Vietnam agreements is
the end of hostilities, and that the DMZ is in no way a political
or territorial boundary; the political settlement of Vietnam to
be achieved in the near future.
