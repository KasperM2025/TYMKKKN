even been carried out against a few “lucrative” POL targets deep
within the circles.

The program had also become more expensive. 318 ROLLING
THUNDER aircraft were lost during 1966, as compared with 171 in 1965
(though the loss rate dropped from .66% of attack sorties in 1965 to
.39% in 1966). CIA estimated that the direct operational cost of the
program (i.e., production costs of aircraft lost, plus direct sortie
overhead costs -- not including air base or CVA maintenance or logistical
support -- plus ordnance costs) came to $1,247 million in 1966 as com-
pared with $460 million in 1965. 98/

Economic damage to NVN went up from $36 million in 1965
to $94 million in 1966, and military damage from $34 million to $36 million.
As CIA computed it, however, it cost the U.S. $9.6 to inflict $1 worth of
damage in 1966, as compared with $6.6 in 1965. 99/

Estimated civilian and military casualties in NVN also went
up, from 13,000 to 23-24,000 (about 80% civilians), but the numbers
remained small relative to the 18 million popula ion. 100/

The program in 1966 had accomplished little more than in
1965, however. In January 1967, an anlaysis by CIA concluded that the
attacks had not eliminated any important sector of the NVN economy or
the military establishment. They had not succeeded in cutting route
capacities south of Hanoi to the point where the flow of supplies required
in SVN was significantly impeded. The POL attacks had eliminated 76% of
JCS-targeted storage capacity, but not until after NVN had implemented a
system of dispersed storage, and the POL flow had been maintained at
adequate levels. 32% of NVN's power-generating capacity had been put
out of action, but the remaining capacity was adequate to supply most
industrial consumers. Hundreds of bridges were knocked down, but vir-
tually all of them had been quickly repaired, replaced, or bypassed, and
traffic continued. Several thousand freight cars, trucks, barges, and
other vehicles were also destroyed or damaged, but inventories were main-
tained through imports and there was no evidence of a serious transport
problem due to equipment shortages. The railroad and highway networks
were considerably expanded and improved during the year. 101/

The main losses to the economy, according to the CIA
analysis, had been indirect -- due to a reduction in agricultural out-
put and the fish catch, a cut in foreign exchange earnings because of
a decline in exports, disruptions of production because of dispersal
and other passive defense measures, and the diversion of effort to
repair essential transportation facilities. On the military side, damage
had disrupted normal military practices, caused the abandonment of many
facilities, and forced the widespread dispersal of equipment, but overall
military capabilities had continued at a high level. 102/
