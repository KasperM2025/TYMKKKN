South China and assistance given Viet Minh by Mao Tse-
Tung Govt gives fol results:

Effectives of Chi forces stationed southern provinces
bordering on Tonkin have increased in last six months
from 170,000 to 290,000 men.

roads leading to Tonkin border being constantly re-
conditioned and already much improved in correlation

highways in Viet Minh area of north Tonkin are being
reconditinned. For instance Kunming-Yen Bay road now
open to traffic.

Lastly, Chi materiel aid to Viet Minh has vastly in-

ereased over last three months. During recent opera-
tions French have ascertained that great part captured
equipsient was of US origin and have seized arms dated
