Part of the mystery as to why the numbers in the JCS analysis
which we have just discussed differ from those stipulated by Secre-
tary Vance in his request for an analysis of Courses A and B is
explained by a 29 May 1967 memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. In it, General Wheeler identi-
fied certain factual corrections and annotations noted by the Joint
Chiefs which should be entered so as to provide a "common basis of
factual material." The corrections, General Wheeler noted, were factual
only and did not address matters of policy, strategy, judgment, or
opinion, as expressed in the Draft Presidential Memo of 19 May. He
went on to comment that as the draft memorandum for the President
indicated, COMUSMACV message 09101, 18 March 1967, included a "minimum
essential force" for FY 68 and looking beyond, a probable requirement
for an “optimum force" through FY 69. These forces totaled 4-2/3
division or force equivalents and 10 TFS -- 2-1/3 of these division
force equivalents and 5 of the TFS to be deployed in FY 68 and the
remainder thereafter. COMUSMACV estimated these forces at about
200,000. 20/ However, the Chairman continued, “the changed situation
in South Vietnam including the formation and deployment of Task Force
OREGON, the addition by CINCPAC of other PACOM requirements, and
revised service estimates [naa] caused variation in the total numbers
for FY 68 and beyond. While exact numbers of the larger forces
[could not/ then be determined unless detailed troop lists are developed
the following appeared at this time to reflect more accurately the
probable personnel strengths, end strength increases and costs required
to provide COMUSMACV a 4-2/3 DFE/PFS optimum force and the additional
requirements through FY 69 that have been stated by CINCPAC.

Additional Forces for SEA ---------------- 250,000
Additional Service End Strengths --------- 600,000

Estimated Additional Costs thru FY 69
over Approved FY 68--------- 12,000,000 " 21/

General Wheeler concluded that although the Joint Chiefs of Staff
had not recommended the deployment of COMUSMACV's optimum force or even
adoption of Course A as used in the Draft Presidential Memorandum, that
the corrected figures which he quoted were more nearly representative
of Course A than those of the DPM.

On 20 May, Secretary McNamara sent a short memorandum to the
President replying to his request for comments on Senator Brooke's letter
of 19 May, which proposed integration of the National Liberation Front
into some kind of viable political role in South Vietnam's government
or in its political life. Although these views coincided very closely
