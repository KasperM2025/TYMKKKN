The VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi, allocated 50 and 20 seats respec-
tively, were thus less than 50% represented, and the Marxists group, the
smallest in the Assembly, was, according to all surviving evidence, the
most active and influential. During the two weeks the Assembly was in
session, a number of opposition members were arrested and charged with
criminal offenses. When the Assembly closed, 20 Dong Minh Hoi and VNQDD
members remained, and of these, only 2 registered dissenting votes.

The new constitution, ratified on 8 November 1946 by the National
Assembly with a vote of 240 to 2, ordained in phrases reminiscent of
Jefferson and Rousseau a state of guaranteed civic freedoms, of delineated
duties and rights of citizens, and of a people's parliament supreme in
power. Thereafter, the Assembly adjourned until late 1953, and never
did get around to transforming itself into constitutionally prescribed
form. 5h/ The 1946 Constitution declared Vietnam to be a democratic
republic in which all power belonged to the people "without distinction
of race, class, creed, wealth, or sex." Its territory, "composed of Bac-
Bo, or Northern Viet Nam (Tonkin), Trung-Bo or Central Viet Nam (Annam),
and Nam-Bo or Southern Viet Nam (Cochinchina) is one and indivisible...
The capital of Viet Nam is Hanoi." 55/ However, the Constitution of
1946 never became institutionalized; instead, the exigencies of the war
with the French eventuated in a government which was literally an adminis-
trative extension of 4 rigidly disciplined politico-military apparatus
headed by Ho Chi Minh, and a cadre of his old comrades from the Indochina
Communist Party. 56/

The government approved by the National Assembly on 3 November 196,
however, preserved some of the facade of coalition; although the key cabi-
net positions were filled by communists, the government included indepen-
dents, democrats, socialists and even one nominal VNQDD. Figure 5 presents
the several Vietnamese governments in the period 1945-1949. Ho Chi Minh
throughout that period preserved coalition, at least pro forma; the DRV
government in 1949 was still composed of a minority of ICP members and
included one VNQDD and one Dong Minh Hoi. (The chart ignores the Lien
Viet, using the more familiar Viet Minh throughout; the Vietnamese
Nationalist Party is the VNQDD. )
