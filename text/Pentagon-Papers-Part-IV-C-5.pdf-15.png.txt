Agency & Action in Vietnan

JCS recommended in con-
junction with program for
the. lst eight weeks of air
activity against NVN the
eollatoral action of land-
ing one MEB at Da Nang for
security of the air base.

JCS reiterated CINCPAC
recommendation to land MEB
at Da Nang. Presence of
the Marines would serve to
deter vc/DRV action against
the base and would enhance
readiness posture for other
contingencies.

. Westmoreland recommended

landing of 2/3 of MEB to
secure base and installa-

tions at Da Nang.

Taylor coneurred in MACV's
request to the extent of
1/3 MEB for security but
warned against further
foreign troop deployments.

Westmoreland backed down
to 173 MEB with proviso
that more could follow
after lst battalion was
in place.
