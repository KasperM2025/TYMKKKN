source then his Concept of Operations. 182/ The Concept was developed
through three distinct phases:

Phase I -- The commitment of US/FWMAF forces necessary to halt the
losing trend by the end of 1965.

Phase II ~- The resumption of the offensive by US/FWMAF forces
during the first half of 1966 in high priority areas necessary to destroy '
enemy forces, and reinstitution of rural construction activities.
Phase III -~- If the enemy persisted, a period of a year to a year
and a half following Phase II would be required for the defeat and de-
struction of the remaining enemy forces and base areas.
Withdrawal of US /FWMAF forces would commence following Phase TLE

as the GVN became able to establish and maintain internal order and to
defend its borders.

The overall Concept was based on some assumptions:

(1) That the VC would fight until convinced that military victory
was impossible and then would not be willing to endure further punishment.

(2) That the Chinese Communists would not intervene except to
provide aid and advice.

(3) That friendly forces would maintain control of the air over
RVN. J

The specific military tasks associated with each phase of the
Concept were spelled out as follows:

Phase J

(1) Secure the major military bases, airfields and communications
centers.

(2) Defend major political and population centers.

(3) Conduct offensive operations against major VC base areas
in order to divert and destroy VC main forces.

(4) Provide adequate reserve reacticn forces to prevent the loss
of secure and defended areas.

(5) Preserve and strengthen the RVNAF.

(6) Provide adequate air support, both combat and logistic.
