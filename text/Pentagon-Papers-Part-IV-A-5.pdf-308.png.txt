"MR. DURBROW. Not only in the south, sir; they were concentrated
down there, but they were all over the country, the Communists,
in particular.

"The sects were in the southwest basically, and in Saigon,
but as far as the Binh Xuyen is concerned, they were primarily in
the Saigon-Cholon area.

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. Yes.

"There was little real military strength to resist a Vietminh
invasion from the north had it come about at that time?

"MR. DURBROW. Very little, sir.

"SENATOR MANSFIEID. South Vietnam was a war-prostrated area with
very extensive devastation?

"MR. DURBROW. Quite correct. ‘There is still evidence of that, sir.

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. There were hundreds of thousands of refugees
from the north waiting to be resettled, the figure being somewhere
between 600,000, the official figure, and 1 million?

"MR. DURBROW. Correct.

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. ‘These’ conditions have changed in significant
degree in the past 4 years, have they not?

"MR. DURBROW. Very much so."

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. And there is a far greater degree of internal
stability and security in Vietnam than there was in 1955?

"AMBASSADOR DURBROW. Very definitely.

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. I should like to read into the record at
this point a statement by Maj. Gen. Samuel L. Myers, former
Deputy Chief of MAAG in Vietnam. General Myers stated on
April 17 of this year, and I quote:

"The Binh Xuyen group was completely eliminated as
a& menace. The Cao Dai group was pacified or reoriented
through political means to a point where it ceased to
be any considerable obstacle. The Hoa Hao had been
reduced to a handful of the diehards still holding out
against the Government and still conducting extremely
limited armed raids and assassinations. The Vietminh
guerrillas, although constantly reinforced by men and
weapons from outside South Vietnam, were gradually
nibbled away until they ceased to be a major menace
