DESCRIPTION

In a speech at the White House, the Presi-
dent indicates that the DRV has turned
back all peace initiatives, either from
the US or from neutral parties.

Taylor confirms the President's view about
the DRV by noting that in Hanoi's esti-
mates they are still expecting to

achieve a clear-cut victory and see no
reason to negotiate.

Commenting, at the President's request,

on McCone's parting memo on Vietnam, Ra-
born agrees with the assessment that the
bombing had thus far not hurt the North
and that much more would be needed to
force them to the negotiating table. He
suggests a pause to test DRV intentions
and gain support of world opinion before
beginning the intensive air-campaign that
he believes will be required. ‘aaa

‘The Chairman of the JCS recommends to the

Secretary that the SAM sites already iden-
tified be attacked.

The President informs Taylor of his inten-
tion to call a temporary halt to the bomb-
ing and asks Taylor to get PM Quat's con-
eurrence. The purpose of the pause is to
gain flexibility either to negotiate if
the DRV shows interest, or to intensify
the air strikes if they do not. He does
not intend to announce the pause but
rather to communicate it privately to
Moscow and Hanoi and await a reply.

Taylor reports Quat's agreement but pre-
ference not to have the pause linked to

Buddha's birthday.

State confirms the decision, agrees to
avoid reference to the Buddhist holiday,
and indicates that the pause will begin
on May 13 and last for 5-7 days.
