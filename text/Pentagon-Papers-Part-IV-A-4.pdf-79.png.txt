TOP SECRET - Sensitive

1955 because of the continued employment of the VNA against the sects
and ar of the French phaseout, which was well underway during that
year. 83 : :

The continuing conflict with sect forces, the reduction and even-
tual withdrawal of the FEC, the lack of a capability to demobilize
efficiently, concern about overloading the economy with unemployed
veterans (potential grist for the sects';and for the Communists' mill),
and the fact that the 88,000-men VNA was viewed as only slightly larger
than the sect forces alone led the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense (MOD) ,
to object to the 88,000 force level in 1954. As a first compromise,
CHMAAG indicated that the U.S, would agree to supporting a goal of
100,000 by the end of 1955; the same factors led to O'Daniel's recom-
mendation of a goal of U.S.-supported forces of 150,000 (plus 10,000
sect-troops) by 1 July 195). 8:/ Ambassador Reinhardt and CINCPAC
fully endorsed O'Daniel's recommendation, and the JCS recommended ap-
proval of this force basis. 85/ Upon DOD approval, MAAG inmedieately
began plenning for the reorganization of Vietnamese forces "according
to American concepts" 86/ and at the newly approved level. The organiz-
ing and training of this force of } field divisions, 6 light divisions,
13 territorial regiments, 1 airborne RCT, and supporting troops, plus an
air force and navy of limited size, was to occupy MAAG until the reorgani-

zation of 1959. 87/

To accomplish this task, MAAG had a total strength of 3h2 officers
and men, of which 220 were assigned TRIM in February 1955. With the
French withdrawing versonnel engaged in processing’ MDAP equipment, MAAG
found it difficult to supervise redistribution and end use of this
material. 88/ As early as February, before the French began to withdrew,
O'Daniel had reported he needed twice the authorized MAAG strength to
accomplish this mission; 89/ hoth O'Daniel and CINCPAC argued against
the State Denartment's interpretation that Article 16 of the Geneva
Agreement held MAAG to a ceiling of 342 personnel and the JCS recommended
"that the Secretary of Defense inform the National Security Council of
the gravity of the situation in Vietnem, requesting the euthority to
raise the 342 limitation;" 90/ and the Secretary of Defense, in forward-
ing these dissenting views to the Secretary of State, agreed with the
dissenter. 91/ Before the Secretary of State could reply to the DOD
inquiry, an interagency costing team which had just returned from Vietnam
reported that because of the reduction in French personnel control of
MDAP supplies and spaces had been lost and that as a result, "the capa-
bility of supply of forces in the field in the event hostilities should
be resumed in mid-1956 would be virtually non-existent." 92/

On February 3, 1956, the Department of State acquiesced in the
ereation of the Temporary Bouivment Recovery Mission (TERM). ¢3/ By
the end of 1956, this grouo of 350 militery personnel had greatly facili-
tated the recovery and redistribution of MDAP equipment; although they
