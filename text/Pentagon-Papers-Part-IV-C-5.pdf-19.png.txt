SecDef &

Amb Taylor

TOP SECRET - Sensitive

JCS reiterated CINCPAC's
recommendation that 1 BLT
and remaining MEB elements
be landed at Da Nang and
one BLT be landed at Phu
Bai -- all to improve
security situation.

Westmoreland predicted that
air activity would not bear
fruit in the next six months,
and in the interim, RVNAF
needed 3d country reinforce-
ments to enable it to offset
vc/DRV build-up and enjoy
favorable force ratios while
permitting an “orderly” build-
up of its own forces. MACV
wanted the equivalent of two
divisions by June '65 and
possibly more thereafter if
bombing failed. Westmoreland
proposed deploying Marines

as. described in JCSM 216-65,
an Army brigade in Bien Hoa,/
Vung Tau, and an Army division
to the II CTZ highlands with

@ couple of battalions to pro-
tect coastal bases. The mission
of these forces was to be defense

.of vital installations and defeat

of VC efforts to control Kontun,
Pleiku, Binh Dinh region.

Taylor told State that if U.S.
forces were to come in for combat,
he favored offensive enclave -
mobile reaction concept of employ-
ment rather than territorial clear
and hold in highlands or defensive
enclave. .

JCS three division plan presented
to Taylor. The latter inclined to
disfavor it because too many troops
were involved, the need wasn't
manifest, and the Viets would
probably resent it. SecDef was
inclined to favor the proposal

but: desired more information in
reference to the Taylor qualifi-
cations.
