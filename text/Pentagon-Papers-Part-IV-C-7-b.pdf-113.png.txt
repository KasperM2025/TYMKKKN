Their recommendations, in turn, are based on those of

field commanders. Field commanders are under instruc-

tions not to recommend certain targets in certain areas--
Haiphong docks, the air defense command center in Hanoi,

and so forth. There is much controversy and some bitterness
about these off-limit targets. There have been fewer and
fewer of them since July. Some new ones went off the list
just last week.

The luncheon meeting continues over coffee until 3:00,
3:30, sometimes even 4:00. When it is over, the President goes
for a nap. The bombing decisions have been made for another

week.

In thinking about Target Tuesday and the White House
luncheon where so many decisions are on the menu, you may
want to consider the words of 19th Century writer F. W. Borum:
"We make our decisions, and then our decisions turn around
and make us."

Even before the Phuc Yen decision was taken, the Chiefs had
sent McNamara for transmittal to the President a major memo outlining
their overall recommendations for the air war as requested by the Presi-
dent on September 12. The President had asked to see a set of proposals
for putting more pressure on Hanoi. On October 17 that was exactly what
he got and the list was not short. The Chiefs outlined their understanding
of the objectives of the war, the constraints within which the national
authorities wished it to be fought, the artificial limitations that
were impeding the achievement of our objectives and a recommended list
of ten new measures against North Vietnam. Since the memo stands as
one of the last major military arguments for the long-sought wider war
against North Vietnam before the trauma of Tet 1968 and the subsequent
U.S. de-escalation, and because of its crisp, terse articulation of the
JCS point of view, it is included here in its entirety.
