McNamara memo to the
President

White House Tuesday Lunch

Ball warns that resumption

will pose a grave danger of
starting a war with China.

He points to the self-generating
pressure of the bombing for
escalation, shows its ineffec-
tiveness and warns of specific
potential targets such as
mining the harbors.

After 37 days the bombing is
resumed but with no spectacu-
lar targets.

This special estimate states

that increasing the scope and
intensity of bombing, including
attacks on POL, would not prevent
DRV support of higher levels of
operations in 1966.

The Chiefs urge a sharp escala-
tion of the air war with maxi-
mum shock effect.

Focusing their recommendations
on POL, the Chiefs call it
“highest priority action not
yet approved.” It would have
a direct effect in cutting
infiltration.

Again attacks on POL are urged.

This memo to the President con-
tained McNamara's bombing
recommendations for April which
included hitting 7 of 9 JCS
recommended POL storage sites.

MecNamara's POL recommendation
is deferred by the President

because of political turmoil

in SVN.
