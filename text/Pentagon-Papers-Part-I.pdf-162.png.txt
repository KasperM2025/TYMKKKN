Some French authors have been prone to credit the U.S. for Ho Chi Minh
and the Viet Minh; e.g., Lucien Bodard, The Quicksand War (Boston:
Little, Brown, 1967), 221-222. The ranking American official in northern
Vietnam in 1945, Brigadier General Philip E. Gallagher, has attested:
",.-throughout the months before the Japanese capitulation, 0.S.S.
officers and men operated behind Japanese lines, to arm, lead and train
native guerrillas who were organized by the Viet Minh." (A situation
report, undated, in the Gallagher Papers, quoted in Bert Cooper, John
Killigrew, and Norman La Charité, Case Studies in Insurgency and Revolu-
tionary Warfare: Vietnam 191-1954 /Washington, D. C.: Special Opera-
tions Research Office, The American University, 1964, 107.) But 0.8.8.
assistance to the Viet Minh-led guerrillas was quite limited, although
it gave the Viet Minh the opportunity to proclaim that they were part
of the Allied effort against the Japanese. Cf., Fall, Le Viet-Minh:

La République Démocratique du Viet-Nam [Paris: Librairie Armand Colin,
1960/7, 34. Fall, Two Viet-Nams, op. cit., 66-71, details the case

for the postwar American aid and comfort to the Viet Minh, which adds
up to a more substantial charge -- but similarly is without foundation
in the record.
