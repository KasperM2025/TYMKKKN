DESCRIPEION

in an effort to streamline the BEnbassy
and increase his policy -control, Taylor
forms the Mission Council at th
Country Team level.

Taylor calls on Khanh who expresses
satisfaction with the new personnel,
approves the Mission Council idea and
offers to create a counter part organi- ~
zation.

The President asks Taylor to submit
regular month-end progress reports on
all aspects of the program.

Taylor raises the estimate of Viet Cong
strength from the previous total of
28,000 to 34,000. This does not repre-
sent a sudden increase, but rather

. intelligence confirmation of long sus-

pected units.

As he had promised, Khanh creates a
coordinating group within the GVN to
deal with the new Mission Council and
calls it the NSC.

In a public speech, Khanh refers to

the "March to the North." In a sepa-
rate statement to the press, General
Ky also refers to the "march North."

In a meeting with Khanh and the NSC,

Taylor is told by Khanh that the move
against the North is indispensible to
the success of the counterinsurgency
campaign in the South.

In a discussion of coup rumors, Khanh
complains that it is US support of
Minh that is behind all the trouble,
Taylor reiterates US support for Khanh.

The destroyer USS Maddox ig ettacked
in the Tonkin Gulf by DRV patrol craft
while on a DE SOTO patrol off the DRV
eoast. Several patrol boats sunk.
