It is also the nolicy of his government to win the war in
Indochinas To do this; they are prepared to adopt the
general principles of the lavarre plan, including sending
approximately nine battalions of additional troops to
Indochina. However, the cost of sending and maintaining
these additional troovs in Indochina, »lus the cost of
arming, training, and equipping the necessary additional
battalions of Vietnam troons, will be approximately 100
billion francs for the French calendar year 1954. There-
fore, the Laniel government, in order to carry out its
overall plan of winning the war in Indochina and balancing
the French budget, needs an eS 150 billion franes
for Indochina in calendar 1954 Laniel said that the 100
billion frane figure for the extra cost in Indochina in
1954 was a maximum figure, and thet he had instructed
General Navarre to do his best to reduce it somewhat.

Laniel said that 3idault had reported, after his Washing-
ton trip, that the Secretary of State and ir. Stassen had
told him that there was no hope of getting any additional
funds whatsoever from the US for Indochina, and that 3idault
was very discouraged to have to make this report. Laniel
added that there was no point in sending any additional
French forces from France to Indochina unless the funds
were also available to build up the Vietnam army for its
eventual assumption of resporsibility. He vointed out that
it would be impossible for him to make the economies which
he plans to make in tne civil areas of the budget unless

he can make similar economies in the military side of the
budget, including Indochina. If funds are not available
