W. Bundy memo to Warnke,

Taylor memo to the President

Moscow msg 2983

DPM

Clifford Group meeting

DPM

_ 2h

Bundy considers several
alternative courses including
mining the harbors and all-out
bombing. Without indicating
& preference he indicates no
unacceptably adverse Soviet
or Chinese reaction to any
course except invasion.

Taylor proposes three possible
packages of responses to Tet
and Westmoreland's request.

All three called for removal of
the San Antonio formula and no
new negotiating initiative.

Thompson gives his assessment
of Soviet reactions to various
US actions. "...any serious
escalation except in South
Vietnam would trigger strong
Soviet response...."

The 3 Mar. draft memo rejects any-
bombing escalation, particularly
mining the harbors or reducing
the Hanoi-Haiphong restriction
circles. It also rejects West-
moreland's troop requests.

The Clifford Group rejects the
DM's “demographic frontier"
tactical concept for SVN and is
divided about the bombing.
Wheeler is adamant for an
escalation.

A new draft is completed and
Clifford sends it to the Presi-
dent. It proposes no new peace
initiative and includes both the
JCS proposal for escalation of
the bombing, and the ISA posi-
tion that it should be stabilized.
In transmitting the DPM, Clifford
apparently also suggested to the
President the idea of halting

the bombing north of 20°, an idea
discussed in the Clifford Group.
