of those who builds such a counter-terrorism precinct organiza-
tion.,.The military should take special precautions in their
operations not to injure in any way the non-combatants. It
must also behave itself so well that the people like the
Army..." 20/

social organizations and should have an executive who directs.

"3, With the help of the police or military, conduct a
census.
