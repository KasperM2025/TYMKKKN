security requirements demanded

first priority, that economic and
social programs had to be accelerated,
that it was in the US interest to pro-

support en ARVN increase to 200,000

social reforms supposedly required

in return for US assistance.

Although collapse of the Saigon

decides it must intervene, White
asked if we had the people, instru-

efficiency, a spirit of renewed
confidence is "beginning to permeate
the people, the GVN end the Armed

Forces."
