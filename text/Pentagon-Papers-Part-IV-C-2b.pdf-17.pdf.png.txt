DESCRIPTION

Declaring a state of emergency,
General Khanh proclaimed him-
self President of South Viet-

~ nam and claims virtual dicta-
torial powers.

Concern over not provoking a
communist military escalation
in Laos, particularly in view
of the Tonkin Gulf reprisals,
prompted State to defer tempo-
rarily approval of air and
ground initiatives in the
Laotian panhandle.

Taylor opposes a 14-nation

Geneva Conference as likely

to undermine the little stability
the fragile GVN still has.

He further states that the
reprisals, while effective in

‘the short run, do not deal with

the continuing problem of DRV
infiltration which must be
confronted. He felt there
was need for follow-up action
to demonstrate to the DRV that
the rules of the game had
changed.

Through the Canadian representa-
tive on the ICC, the U.S. com-
municated its uncertainty about
DRV motives in the Aug 4 Tonkin
Gulf raids, that additional

air power deployed to SEA was
precautionary, that U.S. offi-

cial and public patience was

wearing thin, that the Congres-
sional resolution demonstrated
U.S. determination in SEA,

and that if the DRV pursued its
present course, it could expect
to suffer the consequences.

Assistant Secretary of State
Bundy felt that only a continu-
ous combination of military

“pressure and communication
