Furthermore, it is not clear that the entire 9th Division should be
‘afloat, one brigade at the Dong Tam Base and one brigade at a base in III
Corps (in addition to the separate mechanized battalion). These forces,
working with the ARVN, should be adequate to counter the VC main force
_units and provide needed security for the RK) effort. The threat in IV
Corps is primarily from small units and guerrillas and should be encountered
on that level, not with multi-brigade operations. i

A greater return can probably be realized by giving the ARVN better
support rather than increasing the size of the U.S. forces. The 2 ARVN
divisions in IV Corps have less than half the artillery support of U.S.
forces; five 105/155mm tubes and no heavy artillery tubes per ARVN
battalion (in U.S. Army battalion equivalents) compared to ten 105/155mm
tubes plus two and one half 175mm and 8" tubes per battalion for the U.S.

. Army forces. In addition, the amount of tactical air and armed helicopter
support provided the ARVN forces country-wide is meager conpared to that
provided U.S. forces. During the 4th quarter of 1966 each U.S. battalion
‘received about 500 hours per month of UH-1 support versus only 120 hours
per battalion-equivalent for ARVN. In IV Corps the ARVN received 280
hours per battalion per month; in the other corps areas only 60 hours.
There is no indication MACV has-the same sense of urgency about increasing
ARVN effectiveness as it has about increasing the number of U.S. forces.
