DESCRIPTION

Lodge recommends that when
Conein is contacted again, he °
be authorized to say that the
U.S, will not thwart a coup,
that we are willing to review
plans, and that we will con-
tinue support to a successor
regime.

His identity having been com-
promised in recent press stories
about internal policy struggles
in the U.S. mission, CIA Chief
of Station, John Richardson,

is recalled to Washington.

Washington clarifies its views

on @ coup by stating that the
U.S. will not thwart such 4

move if it offers prospects

of a more effective fight against
the VC. Security and denia-
bility of all contacts is para-
mount.

The newly elected National
Assembly convenes to hear

Diem's State of the Union
address. Diem speaks mainly

of Vietnam's past progress under
his rule, playing down the
current political crisis and
making only scant reference to
U.S. aid.

Mme Nhu arrives in the U.S.

from Europe for a three-week
speaking tour. She immedi-
ately launches into vituperative
attacks on the U.S. and its

role in Vietnam.

The UN General Assembly, after
a strong debate with many voices
denouncing Diem'’s anti-Buddhist
policy, votes to send 4 fact-
finding team to Saigon to
investigate the charges of
repression.
