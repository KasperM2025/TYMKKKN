dissuaded Diem from taking on
Bay Vien's 6000-man force at
this time, and the French then
negotiated a truce between Diem
and the Binh Xuyen.

Collins says Diem has proved
himself incapable of inspiring
unity, and must be replaced.
Dulles demurs, then agrees to
consider a change if Collins
will fly to Washington for
consultations.

Diem calls for a national
referendum and elections for a
national assembly within six
months. The Front scores the
proposal.

(Collins had left Saigon for
Washington.) Diem replaces Sang
with a man loyal to his regime
but Sang refuses to resign saying
only Bao Dai had the legal auth-
ority to remove him.

Collins met with Dulles in
Washington. Dulles agreed to
consider an alternate to Diem

but was determined to keep this
from the French until their pur-
poses were clear and their promise
to unequivocally support a new
regime firm. Saigon was informed
of this new policy.

Diem struck at the Surete--and
Sang--after fighting erupted
between the VNA and Binh Xuyen
forces in Cholon. The French
said Diem instigated the fight;
Americans supported Diem's version
that the Binh Xuyen began firing
first. Whatever its origin, the
fight ended with a VNA victory.
The Binh Xuyen were driven out of
Cholon into the Rung Sat swamps.
