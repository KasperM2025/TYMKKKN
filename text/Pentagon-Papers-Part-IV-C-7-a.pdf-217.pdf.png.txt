had developed and presented to the Secretary of Defense an integrated
plan to perform these tasks, but much of it had never been approved.
Therein lay the cause of whatever failure could be attributed to the
bombing in Admiral Sharp's view.

The rest of the briefing was a long complaint about the
lack of authorization to attack the Haiphong harbor in order to deny
external assistance, and the insignificant number of total sorties
devoted to JCS numbered targets (1% of some 81,000 sorties). Never-
theless, CINCPAC was convinced the concept of operations he had pro-
posed could bring the DRV to give up the war if "self-generated US
constraints" were lifted in 1967. 107/

Thus, as 1966 drew to a close, the lines were drawn for
a long fifteen month internal Administration struggle over whether to
stop the bombing and start negotiations. McNamara and his civilian
advisers had been disillusioned in 1966 with the results of the bombing
and held no sanguine hopes for the ability of air power, massively
applied, to produce anything but the same inconclusive results at far
higher levels of overall hostility and with significant risk of Chinese
and/or Soviet intervention. The military, particularly CINCPAC, were
ever more adamant that only civilian imposed restraints on targets had
prevented the bombing from bringing the DRV to its knees and its senses
about its aggression in the South. The principle remained sound, they
argued; & removal of limitations would produce dramatic results. And
so, 1967 would be the year in which many of the previous restrictions
were progressively lifted and the vaunting boosters of air power would be
once again proven wrong. It would be the year in which we relearned the
negative lessons of previous wars on the ineffectiveness of strategic
bombing.
