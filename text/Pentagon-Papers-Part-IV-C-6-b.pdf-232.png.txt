(1) Recommendation: Accelerate the deployment of the 101lst
Division to close all major elements of the Division
prior to 20 December 1967.

Action: Deployment of a brigade task force (3 battalions)
of the 10lst Airborne Division had already been accelerated
from February 1968 to December 1967. The Army now believes
that deployment of the remaining brigade can be accelerated
from February 1968 to January 1968,

(2) Recommendation: Retain the elements of the 9th Marine
Amphibious Brigade now in-country.

Action: The current deployment plan authorizes this action,

(3) Recommendation: Accelerate deployment of the 11th Separate
Infantry Brigade from February 1968 to December 1967.

Action: The Secretary of the Army believes this date can
be met. 85/

The Army, meanwhile, continued to assess the possibility of accelerat-
ing deployment of its Program 5 combat units.

On 16 October 1967, in a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, the
Secretary of the Army indicated that the remainder of the 10l1st AB Division
could be deployed by air to close in Vietnam by 20 December 1967. This
accelerated deployment would require the completion of four weeks of
training in-country prior to commitment to combat. Additional trans-
portation costs to the Army would be $10 M, and support of the element
in South Vietnam over the CONUS cost for the same period would be
approximately $5.3 M. The acceleration, however, would not provide
General Westmoreland an operational element earlier than now programmed,
but would ensure the Division's early closure in South Vietnam in the
event of an extended moratorium on deployment at Christmas. 86/ In
response to this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense asked: Why spend
$15M without an earlier operational capability"? 87/ On 20 October the
Secretary of the Army indicated that, contrary to his earlier assertion,
the Division would be available for operations in South Vietnam five
weeks earlier than the Program 5 availability date.

The Program 5 availability date, using surface transporta-
tion and allowing for one month's in-country orientation, is
1 March 1968. Using air movement and conducting the normal
one-month orientation concurrent with completion of training
will provide an availability date of 22 January 1968. 88/

On 21 October, the Secretary of Defense approved the Army recommen-
dation to deploy by air the remainder of the 10lst Airborne Division (-)

in DÃ©cember 1967. 89/
