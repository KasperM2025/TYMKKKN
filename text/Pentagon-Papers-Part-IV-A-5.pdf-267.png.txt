30 Jan 1957 UN General Assembly's Special Political
Committee endorses a resolution (backed by the
U.S. and 12 other nations) calling for UN
membership for South Vietnam and South Korea.
On the same day, the Committee declines to
endorse a "package deal" proposed by the Soviet
Union for simultaneous admission of North
Vietnam and North Korea.

28 Feb 1957 UN General Assembly recommends to the Security
Council UN membership for South Vietnam and
South Korea (40 to 8 with 18 abstentions, and
40 to 8 with 16 abstentions respectively).

9 Sep 1957 After making an unsuccessful attempt to post-
pone consideration of the question until Viet-
nam had been unified, the USSR vetoed the
admission of the RVN to the UN.

25 Oct 1957 UN General Assembly (by votes 49 to 9, with 23
abstentions) passes resolution declaring that
South Vietnam is eligible for membership in the
UN. The resolution "noted â€˜with regret' the
continued inability of the Security Council
to recommend the admission of /South Korea and
South Vietnam/ . . . to the UN because of the
negative vote of the Soviet Union." (Asian
Recorder, New Delhi, Vol. 111, No. 51.)
