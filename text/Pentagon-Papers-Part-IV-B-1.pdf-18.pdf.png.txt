State (George Ball)

Revision of Task
Force Revort

NSC Meeting

This draft was very different from
the original. lLansdale's role was
eliminated; the Gilpatric-Lansdale
Task Force was to be replaced by a
new group chaired by Ball, then
Undersecretary of State. (Lansdale
reacted with a "strong recommendstion"
that Defense stay out of the cirector-
ship proposed by State and said the
"US past performance and theory of
action, which State apparently desires
to continue, simply offers no sound
basis for winning...") In State's
rewritten political section of the
report, the Defense recommendation

to meke clear US determination to
intervene unilaterally if necessary
to save South Vietnam from communis
was replaced by a proposal to explore
new bilateral treaty arrangements with
Diem (arrangements which might mean
intervention against the guerrillas
but might mean intervention only
against DRV attack). The need for
new arrangements was tied to the
"loss" of Laos. State incorporated
unchanged the Defense draft as the
military section of its revised
report, but implied "further study”
would be given to some Defense recom-
mendations. Overall, the State
revision tried to tone down commit-
ments to Vietnam suggested in the
Defense version. It left the Presi-
dent a great deal of room to maneuver
without explicitly overruling recom-

‘mendations presented him.

Again, Laos was the main subject.
Most agreed the chance for salvaging
anything out of the cease-fire and
coalition government was slim indeed,
Ways in which to reassure Vietnam and
Thailand were sought. The Vice
President's trip to Southeast Asia
was announced after the meeting.
