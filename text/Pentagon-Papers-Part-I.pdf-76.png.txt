As for the 0.8.5., the ranking American official in northern
Vietnam in 1945, Brigadier General Philip E. Gallagher, has
attested: "...throughout the months before the Japanese capitu-
lation, 0.5.5. officers and men operated behind Japanese lines,

to arm, lead and train native guerrillas who were organized by

the Vietminh." (A situation report, undated, in the Gallagher ~
Papers, quoted in Bert Cooper, John Killigrew, and Norman LaCharite,
Case Studies in Insurgency and Revolutionary Warfare: Vietnam 1941-
1954 /Washington, D.C.: Special Operations Research Office, The
American University, 19647, p. 107-) Other sources conelude, how-
ever, that 0.8.5. assistance to the Viet Minh-led guerrillas was
extremely limited, although it gave the Viet Minh the opportunity

to proclaim that they were part of the Allied effort against the
Japanese. (See Fall, Le Viet-Minh: La Re ubligque Democratigque

du Viet-Nam /Paris: Librairie Armand Colin, 1960/, p. 3h; Cooper,
Killigrew, and LaCharit√©, op. cit.)
