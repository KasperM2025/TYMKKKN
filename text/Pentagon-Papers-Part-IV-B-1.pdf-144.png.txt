This is a new and dangerous Communist technique which bypasses
our traditional political and military responses. While the
final answer lies beyond the scope of this report, it is clear

when we must declare our intention to attack the source of
guerrilla aggression in North Vietnam and impose on the Hanoi
Government a price for participating in the current war which

is commensurate with the damage being inflicted on its neighbors
to the south. 37/
