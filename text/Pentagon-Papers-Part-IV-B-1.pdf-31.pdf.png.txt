This may have been prepared at
Kennedy's specific instruction;

it recommended what Kennedy

wanted to hear: that the decision
to commit major ground forces could
be deferred. Inthis paper, rhetoric
is escalated from that of Mcliemara's
8 Waovember memorandun but U.S.
ections recommended are far less
significant, less committing. Mili-
tery courses are divided into two
phases: first, promptly deploy sup-
port troops and equinment (heli-
copters, transport aircraft, mari-
time equipment and trainers, special
intelligence end air reconnaissance
groups, other men and materiel to
improve training, logistics, econo-
mic and other assistance programs),
Then study and possibly deploy

major ground combat forces at a
later date. Despite the clear warn-
ing that even deployment of major
U.S. units could not assure success
against communism, the memorandum's
initial recommendation was that the
U.S. "commit itself to the clear
objective of preventing the fall of
South Vietnam to Coumunism,‚Äù be pre-
pared to send troops and to "strike at
the source of aggression in North Viet-

nam." <A number of diplomatic moves

(in the U.N., in NATO and SEATO coun-
cils,. etc.) are suggested to signal U.S
determination; economic, social and
other programs designed to help South
Vietnam are suggested; ways to elicit
improvements from Diem are recom-
mended.

This was Nolting's guidance, based
on the Rusk/Mcliamara memorandum.
Nolting was told the anti-guerrilla
effort "must essentially be a GVN
task...No amount of extra aid can

be substitute for GVN taking measures
to permit [ie] to assume offensive
