fered Annamese complete independence within French community:
That this meant that Annamese would have benent of French advisers
In every Cepartment of Government: That for instance Annamese
Foreign Office would express its policies through French channels:
That Annamese Army and War Ministry would be caordiuated with
French Army and War Ministry: And that Annamese if [777] Finance
and Commerce Ministries world heed French advisers as Annamese
were inexpert in these matters and might jeopardize [anparent garble]
French inveshnent. Sainteny said that Annamese in Cochin China
would prebably prefer to remain French Colony rather come mder
northern \nnamese Government. In this connection Tlo Chi Minh
said that French officials had conferred with him but that they were
vague in their comments and had avoided the real issues of Aunamese
independence so that he had asked them to get specific terms from
Paris which would make clear whether the French really offered
Annamese independence or were merely using new language fo de-
seribe usual French control \anamese affairs.
