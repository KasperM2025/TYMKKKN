DESCRIPLTON

The Secretary approves a JCS pro-
posal for shore bombardment, naval
patrols and.offshore aerial recce
for the first thirty days. A de-
cision on the Phase II was deferred.

As planned, the NSC approved armed

air recce over the Laotian corridor
with the exact number and frequency
of the patrols to be controlled by

SecDef.

The first sorties of U.S, aircraft
in the ‘hrmed recce"” of the Laotian
corridor, known as BARREL ROLL,
take place. They mark the begin-
ning of the thirty-day Phase I of
the limited pressures.

Secretary McNamara sets two mis-
sions of four aircraft each as the
weekly level of BARREL ROLL activ-

ity.

The NSC Principals approve McNamara's
recommendation that BARRELL ROLL
missions be held at constant levels
through Phase I. It is revealed that
adverse sea conditions have brought
maritime operations against the DRV
to a virtual halt. At McNemara's in-
sistence it is agreed that the infil-
tration study will not be made public.

Late in the evening, the military
high command, led by Khanh, moved to
remove all power from the civilian
regime or Premier Huong by dissolv-
ing the High National Council, Khanh
assumes power.

in a meeting with the leading South
Vietnamese military officers, Taylor
once again outlined the actions .
