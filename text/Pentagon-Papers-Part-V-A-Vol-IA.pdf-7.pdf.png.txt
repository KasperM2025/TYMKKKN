TRUMAN ADMINISTRATION
SUMMARY

The statements enclosed are from the period 1950 - 1952: from
the Secretary of State's announcement marking the beginning of the
U.S. involvement in Vietnam to the NATO resolution supporting the
French fight in Indochine. The justifications advanced for the U.S.
commitment in Indochina include the followings:

a. The Soviets are engaged in a "monstrous conspiracy to
stemp out freedom all over the world," and Soviet imperialism, with
Communist China as its instrument, poses a direct threat to the inde-
pendence of the Associated States of Indochina.

b. The defense of Indochina is an integral part of the
worldwide resistance by free nations to communist aggression and sub-
version.

c. The raw materials and agricultural products of Southeast
Asia are â€œvitally needed" by the free nations of the world.

d. The United States, in the interest of preventing a third
world war, has provided aid to the Associated States and France.
