requiring continuing Washington level political review were within the
reduced attack zone. A very significant chapter in the history of U.S.
involvement in the Vietnam war had come to a close.

As those who struggled with the policy decisions about the
bombing came to learn, any dispassionate and objective appraisal of it is
almost impossible. As McGeorge Bundy noted in September 1967 after the
Stennis hearings, both its proponents and its opponents have been guilty
of excesses in their advocacy and criticism.. As Bundy put it, "My own
summary belief is that both the advocates and the opponents of the bombing
continue to exaggerate its importance." 68/ To be sure, the bombing
had not been conducted to its fullest potential, but on the other hand it
had been much heavier and had gone on much longer than many if not most of
its advocates had expected at the outset. Whether more might have been
accomplished by different bombing policy decisions, at the start or along
the way -- in particular the fast full squeeze favored by the JCS -- would
necessarily remain an open question. What can be said in the end is that
its partial suspension in part did produce what most had least expected --
a breakthrough in the deadlock over negotiations. And that in the longer
view of history may turn out to be its most significant contribution.
