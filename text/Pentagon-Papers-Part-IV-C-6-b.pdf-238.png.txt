â€”

On 22 December 1967, the ASD/ISA, in a memorandum to the Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff, forwarded the joint comments of the Secretary of
Defense and the Secretary of State on the JCS recommendations. Their
comments were:

a.

recommend against aerial mining or bombing of North
Vietnamese deep water ports. Possible military gains

are far outweighed by risk of confrontation with Soviets
or Chinese, :

recommend that strike authorization for high density
population centers of government and domestic commerce
continue to be controlled at the highest level of
Government which is most closely in touch with the
political significance of air attacks in these areas.

every recommendation for authorization of a new target should
be considered on its own merits. The military significance
of the target is, of course, a dominant factor in the
evaluation of a target recommendation, but our policy is to
minimize civilization casualties and this consideration must
be weighed in every determination. Recommend no change in
this policy.

recommend authorization for use of CS in rescues in Laos,
Effectiveness of such use can be evaluated against possible
adverse public reaction to use of agents combined with
firepower if conducted in NVN and given propaganda play

by NVN.
