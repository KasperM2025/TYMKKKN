North Vietnam emerged from its war with France in 1954 a food-deficit

area. Densely populated, war-torn, it found itself more than customarily
dependent upon outside supplies of rice and supplemental foods, which it
had usually imported from South Vietnam. Soviet stop-gap aid filled the
food deficit until DRV production was improved. The negative attitude of
the GVN toward any economic relations with the DRV beyond those necessitated
by the Geneva regroupment, in which Diem became progressively more adamant,
created one pressure upon the DRV to seek dependable sources of further aid
abroad. A second stemmed from lack of human and material capital to take
advantage of its natural resources: the North contained all the developed
mineral lodes and most of the established manufacturing in the two Vietnams,
as well as the bulk of electric power capacity in Indochina. 50/ The DRV
needed substantial foreign aid either to press toward modernizing its eens
industry or to collectivize its farms.

a. Agriculture

Foreign aid to the DRV in agriculture, aside from relief
shipments of food, took the form chiefly of technical assistance, both in
management and technique. 51/ Chinese experts in Maoist land reforms
figured prominently in the concept and direction of the collectivization
drives. Russian advisors are believed to have advocated DRV concentration
on mineral and tropical products valuable in communist international trade,
and to have furnished methodological assistance in irrigation, fertilizing,
and the like, but to little avail: labor intensive, hand tool farming in
the traditional fashion persisted. Progress towards collectivization was
perceptible. After retrenching in 1957 following the peasant flare-up, the
regime moved ahead, although more cautiously. At the beginning of 1958,
less than 5% of ihe farm population was in producer cooperatives; enrollments
increased thereafter, and sharply in 1960, from about 55% of peasant house-
holds in July to about 85% in December. About one third of the collectives
were in advanced stages of communal land ownership and shared production;
the remainder represented inchoate socialization, with market incentive
still a mainstay. Performance in agriculture was generally poor, output
never rising above subsistence levels, and slow and erratic growth depressing
progress in other sectors of the economy.

There was, however, perceptible progress:

The DRV gross national product, owing to improvements in both the industrial
and agricultural sectors, grew steadily sane 6% per year after 1958. The
most promising years for the DRV were 1958 and 1959, when performance in
both sectors was extraordinarily good; thereafter, consecutive years of

poor harvests and rapid population increases cut into gains.
