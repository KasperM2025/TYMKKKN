with res pees) to Asia* on the basis of our national security inter-
ests.
ANALYSIS
General Considerations |
2. The peoples and countries of Asia have in common a heavy
pressure of population on scanty or underdeveloped natural re-
sources and a consequent meager standard of living: disruption
experienced in the war; the vigorous nationalistic spirit which
characterizes newly independent states or restive colonies: and
active discontent with their prevailing social, economic and
political institutions, In other words the Asians share poverty,
nationalisn, and revolution, The United States position vith
respect to Asia is therefore that of a rich and powerful country
dealing with a have-not and sensitively nationalistic area, and of
competition together with ene countries against the USSR for
influence on the form and direction of the Asiatic wovcturicns.
¥Por the purposes of this report "Asia" is defined as that part of
the continent of Asia south of the USSR and east of Tran toget ther
pines,

with the major off-shore islands--Japan, Formosa, the Philippi
- Indonesia and Ceylon.
