ee SECURITY INRORMATION

REASON : This subparagraph as Saat written
directs the Department of De eaRe and other agencies to engage
in certain formal planning whieh, in the case of the

Department of efense, would involve the formulation of
specific war plans, In addition, formal military planning
would have to be initiated with the French, with the British,
with the Chinese Nationalist Government, with the Governnent
of Burina, and possibly with other friendly governments, in-
cluding States Members of the United Nations, The Joint
Chiefs of Staff question the feasibility and desirability
of such action and, in any event, from the military point of
view, they would find it impracticable to formulate war plans
for all of the contingencies suggested in tne basic paper
beyond United States military courses of action and force bases
therefor, On the other hand, the Joint Chiefs of Staff support
the desirability of undertaking unilaterally appropriate
stidies of the problem involved. |
