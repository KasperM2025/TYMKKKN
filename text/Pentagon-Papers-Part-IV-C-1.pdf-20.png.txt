DESCRIPPION

MACV informs the JCS that agreement
has been reached with the GVN on the
level of forces to be reached by
year's end.

McNamara-Taylor visit SVN. They are
briefed on 12-13 April by the Mission.
On 1): April they see Khanh who again
talks of going North. McNamara demurs,
but insists on more political stability
and program effectiveness.

Rusk, McNamara, McCone and aides meet
in Honolulu with the Country Team. A
full dress discussion of pressures
takes place, but no decisions or recom-
mendations are approved. Rather, more
emphasis on the critical provinces is
approved, along with an expanded ad-

. Visory effort.

Iedge is informed of the President's
approval of the expanded effort in the
eritical provinces.

Attached to a Bundy memo for considera-
tion at a meeting later the same day,
are six annexes each dealing with a
different aspect of the problem of
getting a Congressional resolution of
support for the current US Southeast
Asian policy. One of the important
themes is that an act of irreversible
US commitment might provide the neces-
sary psychological support to get real
reform and effectiveness from the GVN.

President Johnson announces the appoint-
ment of JCS Chairman, Maxwell Taylor,

to succeed Lodge, who is returning to
engage in Republican Presidential poli-
tics.

lodge leaves Saigon and Taylor takes

over as US Ambassador with U. Alexis
Johnson as Deputy.
