for Indochina, and concludes that victory in Indochina is
international rather than local and essentially political as
well as military. Major General Trapnell Debriefing,

Indochina is the only nation that has the highest MDAP

priority and thus has precedence over everyâ€™ other

nation for allocation of critical military equipment.

The JCS have completed a plan for military intervention

in Indochina and, as well, planned for resumption of

hostilities in Korea. CINCPAC has directed that other

plans be prepared, i.e., blockade of China coast, evacu-~

ation of French forces from Tonkin, etc. Joint Subsidiary

The NSC 195th Meeting considers Secretary Dulles pessi-

mistic report on Geneva to the President: (1) there is

no responsible French Government to deal with, (2) the

British reject the "regional grouping," (3) the British

want secret talks on Southeast Asia, (4) the expected

communist proposal is for foreign troop withdrawal and

elections, (5) and the U.K. wants a settlement based on

partition, NSC 195th Meeting, 6 May 1954........ccceeecceees 425

ference and reviews the weaknesses of Britain's position.
Congress members comments are adverse. Dulles states
three conclusions; (1) U.S. should not intervene mili-
tarily, (2) U.S. must push rapidly for a Southeast Asia
community, (3) and the U.S. should not "write off" the
British and French in spite of their weakness in Asia.
