A recent study* of U.S. assistance establishes that of all U.S.
economic aid programs for less developed countries, 1945 to 1965,
Vietnam has been the fifth ranking recipient and the sixth ranking
per capita. In the decade 1956 to 1965, Vietnam was the fourth rank-
ing recipient and the fourth per capita.
