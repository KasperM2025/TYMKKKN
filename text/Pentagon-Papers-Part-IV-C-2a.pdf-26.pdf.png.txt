operations were said to be needed.

23 May 64 Draft Presidential The crisis in Laos had focused
Memorandum interest on but one stage of
earlier scenarios: overt opera-~
tions against NVN. The scenario
for steps to be taken now had
been dropped (as Rusk explained

NVN had ceased subversion. Nego-

guerrillas to reduce "the level of
insurrections for the moment‚Äù in

or FARMGATE attacks; with Peking and
Moscow, Hanoi might count on inter-

and stabilize communist gains. If
attacks continued, Hanoi might in-
tensify political initiatives and
possibly increase the tempo of insur-
gency. If these failed to bring a
settlement and if attacks damaged
