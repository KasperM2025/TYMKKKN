6. Currently, French and Associated states military forces are not
"only scattered throughout the provinces of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin-China,
as Wel he in Cembodia and Laos, but within these areas anti-Communist
; forces are holed up in small forts, towers, and fortified areas, Most
of these forts have never been subjected to attack. The Freeh have
contended these forts are necessary to guard lines of communication and
control, the countryside. I feel that a striking force of at least 5
divisions could be mobilized from these forces and mobile reserves by
1 October 1953 for employment as a striking force in the north, and so
informed General Navarre in the nature of a suggested plan (see Annex "Gt)
for offensive action in Tonkin during the coming dry season (Oct 53 -
May 54). This would not denudo any area. General Navarre is somewhat
cautious with respect to reducing troops in inactive areas but intends
(and so stated in the Navarre Plan) to mobilize a 3 division striking
force for employment in Tonkin by 15 September 1953.

7. Though the new French High Command is prepared to take certain
essential ad highly desirable steps in the right direction, they wlll 1
not, and perhaps cannot in view of political considerations, consider
umertaking military campaigns designed to achieve total victory with
the forces now available. Consequently, complete military victory will
await the further development of the military forces of the Associated

States or the addition of French divisions from outside Indochina.
