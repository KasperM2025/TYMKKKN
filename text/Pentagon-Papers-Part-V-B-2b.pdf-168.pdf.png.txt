It must be assumed that, in general, French are fighting in
unfriendly territory in ell their military efforts in Vietnam.
Their military operations may be jeopardized by transfer of loyalty
to the Viet Minh throughout Vietnem unless further politically
effective concessions are made by France to Vietnem and the for-
metion of Vietnamese Army is initiated.

Weakness of present French military organization appears to

cy
o

(A) An excessibely static organization of defensive area
with no provisions for mutual support. Detachments from
general reserves are sent to the areas as needed ans pass to
control of area commander,

(B) There are not yet combat organizations greater than
battalion size and this does not provide adequate striking
forces for strong military effort,

(C) Lack of proper coordination of forces. Few air-
ground liaison teams exist,

Conclusions:

(1) There has been unduly exeggerated military impor-
tance attacked to Cao Bang incident; political effect has
been serious,

(2) French military forces have been greatly shocked
by this incident and better reorganization of their fighting
forces can be expected,

(3) Contemplated withdrayal will involve series of diffi-
cult operations and further French losses must be expected,

(4) If adequate military aid arrives within next two
months and French forces in Tonkin receive an additional 9
battalions and are reorganized and properly trained as the
French plen, serious penstrations by Viet Minh of Hanoi-
Haivhong Delta area and coal mines north of Haiphong can be
prevented,

(5) Moncay-Lackay line is over-extended and can be
easily penetreted by Viet Minh forces. Laokay itself offers
little military advantage except as bar to Viet Minh advance
Gown Red River but can be by-passsd or captured by Viet Minh.
Possession of Moncay denies Vist Minh port on the eulf, This
port end the port immediately south, if held, ¢an be used
as bases from which to launch French counter-offensive,
