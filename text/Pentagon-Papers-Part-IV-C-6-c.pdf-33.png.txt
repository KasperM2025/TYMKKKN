support of the VC, it shows no lack of capability or will

to match each new US escalation. Our strategy of "attrition"
has not worked. Adding 206,000 more US men to a force of .
525,000, gaining only 27 additional maneuver battalions and
270 tactical fighters at an added cost te the US of $10 bil-
lion per year raises the question of who is making it costly
from whon. )

(2) Extend GVN dominion, direction and control over
SVN.

(This objective can only be achieved by the GVN through
its political and economic processes and with the indispensable
support of an effective RVNAF. The TET offensive demonstrated
not only that the US had not provided an effective shield, it
also demonstrated that the GVN and RVNAF had not made real
progress in pacification -- the essential first step along the
road of extending GVN dominion, direction and control.)

(3) Defeat the VC and NVA forces in SVN and force
their withdrawal. (The TET offensive proves we were further
from this goal than we thought. How much further remains
+o be seen.)

(4) Deter the Chinese Communists from direct inter-
vention in SHA. (This we have done successfully so far;
however, greatly increased U.S. forces may become counter-
praductive.)

We know that despite a massive influx of 500,000 US troops,
1.2 million tons of bombs a year, 400,000 attack sorties per year,
200,000 enemy KITA in three years, 20,000 US KTA, etc., our control
of the countryside and the defense of the urban areas is now
essentially at pre-August 1965 levels. We have achieved stale-
mate at a high commitment. A new strategy must be sought. 39/

Several alternative strategies were briefly discussed and all but one
were quickly dismissed as being unlikely to bring success:

(1) No change but increase the resources.
This strategy alternative is implicit in the recommenda-
sions of MACV and CJCS....In brief, the MACV and CJCS recommenda-
tions are for additional forces to regair this ground lost since
January, 1968. Nothing is said as to whether still more US
' forces will be required to finish the job. Another payment on
an open-ended commitment is requested.
