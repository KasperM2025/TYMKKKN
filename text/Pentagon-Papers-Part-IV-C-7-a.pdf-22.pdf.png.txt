The Chiefs rebut -the DPM and
call for expansion of the air
war "...to include attacks oa
all airfields, all port com-
plexes, all land and sea lines
of communication in the Hanoi-
Haiphong area, and mining of
coastal harbors and coastal
waters."

McNamara asks CJCS, Dir. CIA,
SecNav, and SecAF to analyze

(a) cutting back bombing to 20Â°;
and (b) intensifying attacks on
LOCs in route packages 6A and 6B
but terminating them against
industrial targets.

CIA opposes the mining of the
harbors as too provocative for
the Soviets.

With the recent attacks on NVN's
power grid 87% of national
capacity had been destroyed.

The Chiefs take strong exception
to the DPM noting its inconsis-
tency with NSAM 288 and the
jeopardy into which it would
place national objectives in SHA
because of the radical and con-
ceptually unsound military
methods it proposed, including
any curtailment of the bombing.

Responding to McNamara's May 20
request for analysis of two
bombing options, Helms states
neither will cut down the flow
of men and supplies enough "to
decrease Hanoi's determination
to persist in the war."

Bundy, like the Chiefs, rejected
the reformulation of objectives
in the May 19 DPM. He leaves
aside the question of the courses
of action to be followed.
