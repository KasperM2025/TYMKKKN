(2) Change Recommendation 5) so as to make
unmistakeble the firm desire of the United States
to send a military aid group to Indochina at the
earliest possible date for the purposes indicated
in your memorandum to the Secretary of State, dated
14 April 1950. In this connection, the Joint Chiefs
of .Staff regard with strong disfavor the desires and
continued attempts of the French to settle, on the
political level, the military and internal security
problems of Indochina in Paris.

Recognizing their own responsibilities in the matter, the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, from the point of view of the military
security interests of the United States, again urge the immediate
establishment of an authoritative United States military aid
group in Indochina.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:
/s/ Omar N. Bradley
OMAR N. BRADLEY,

Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
