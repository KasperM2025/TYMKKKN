regard to that air activity the text of the NSAM said this:

And,

"Subject to continuing review, the President approved
the following general framework of continuing action against
North Vietnam and Laos: Ã©

"We should continue roughly the present slowly ascending
tempo of ROLLING THUNDER operations, being prepared to add
strikes in response to a higher rate of VC operations, or
conceivably to slow the pace in the unlikely event VC slacked
off sharply for what appeared to be more than a temporary
operational lull.

"The target systems should continue to avoid the effective
GCI range of MIGs. We should continue to vary the types of
targets, stepping up attacks on lines of communication in the
near-future, and possibly moving in a few weeks to attacks on
the rail lines north and northeast of Hanoi."

also:
"Air operation in Laos, particularly route blocking opera-
tions in the Panhandle area, should be stepped up to the maximum

remunerative rate."

In regard to action on the ground, NSAM 328 said in relation

to force level increases:

"The President approved an 18-20,000 man increase in U.S.
military support forces to fill out existing units and supply
needed logistic personnel.

"The President approved the deployment of two additional
Marine Battalions and one Marine Air Squadron and associated
headquarters and support elements."

_also:

"The President approved the urgent exploration, with the
Korean, Australian, and New Zealand Governments, of the possi-
bility of rapid deployment of significant combat elements from
their armed forces in parallel with the additional Marine
deployment approved...."

NSAM 328 sanctioned a change in mission for U.S. ground forces

in Vietnam, but it did so in very cautious language:
