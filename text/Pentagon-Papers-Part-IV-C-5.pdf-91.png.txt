D. Where U.S. Stood on 1 June 1965

The beginning of the decisive month of June 1965 saw the U.S.
in the infant stages of its enclave strategy. Established in codstal
enclaves were Marine forces in Phu Bai, Da Nang and Chu Lai and Army
forces in Vung Tau. Enclaves at Qui Nhon and Nha Trang were in the
planning as locations for an Army brigade, and Korean troops were
being considered for the defense of the provincial capital of Quang
Ngai near the coast and as possible relief for the Marines at Chu Lai.
The Secretary of Defense was also considering proposals from General
Westmoreland and others to open up a major logistics base and enclave
around the fine deep water harbor at Cam Ranh Bay. 101/

As of the Ist of June 1965, the U.S. had approved for. perma-
nent deployment to South Vietnam forces which, when all had closed,
would bring total combat strength to approximately 70,000 and the
number of maneuver battalions, Army and Marine, to 13. 102/ Included
in this total were 7 Marine BLT's already located at Phu Bai, Da Nang,
and Chu Lai. Also included were 3 battalions in a brigade of the Army's
ist Division to be landed at Qui Nhon and 3 battalions in a brigade of
the Army's 10lst Airborne Division scheduled to replace the 173rd. In
the planning stages but not yet approved were a further 11 maneuver
battalions, the remaining 2 from the III MAF ("MEF was changed to "MAF"
because the word "Expeditionary" was offensive to the Vietnamese and
was therefore changed to "Amphibious") and 9 battalions planned for the
new Army Airmobile Division.

Third Country forces considered approved at this time amounted
to 7,250 men of which 1,250 were already in-country in the lst Battalion,
Royal Australian Regiment, 2,000 were Korean service troops also already
in-country, and the rest were to be deployed sometime later in a ROK
Regimental Combat Team of 3 battalions. Still in the talking stages
were a further 6 battalions of ROK troops totaling 12,000 men. The grand
total of approved U.S. /3rd Country forces was 17 maneuver battalions and
approximately 77,250 men. If the additional forces then being discussed
were thrown in, the total would have been 34 maneuver battalions and
about 134,750 men. This, then,was the state of the build-up when General
Westmoreland asked on 7 June for reinforcements from the U.S. and Third
Countries "as rapidly as possible." 103/
