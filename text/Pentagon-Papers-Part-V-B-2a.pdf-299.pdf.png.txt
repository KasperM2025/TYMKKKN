States should give immediate consideration to the problems con-
fronting the new Republic of United Indonesia and how best it
can be eaeided in maintaining its freedom in the fece of internal
end externel Communist pressures.

i, Active consideration should be given to means by which
all members of the British Commonwealth may be induced to play
@ more active role in collaboration with the United States in
Asia. Similar collaboration should be obtained to the extent
possible from other non-Communist nations having interests in
Asia.

j- Recognizing that the non-Communist governments of South
Asia already constitute a bulwark against Communist expansion
in Asie, the United States should exploit every opportunity to
increase the present Western orientation of the erea and to es-
sist, within our capabilities, its governments in their efforts
: to meet the minimum aspirations of their people and to maintain
internal security.

k. The United States should undertake an information pro-
gram, both foreign and domestic, end publish United States pol-
icies and programs vis-a-vis Asia designed to gain maximum sup-
port both at home and abroad.

i. Nothing in this paper shall be construed as amending
approved NSC papers unless a specific statement to that effect
has been made on each point.

m, The sum of $75, 000,000 for assistance to the general
area or Chine, which was mede available under Section 303 of

the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, should be programmed
as a matter of urgency.
