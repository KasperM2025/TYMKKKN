self-criticism sessions. Viet Minh cadres and sympathizers would appear
before the audience to swear their disavowal of communism. The peni-

tents would tell tales of Viet Minh atrocities, and rip or trample a
suitable Viet Minh symbol. In February, 1956, tens of thousands of

Saigon citizens assembled to witness the "conversion" of 2,000 former

Viet Minh cadres. Tran Chanh Tanh, head of the GVN Department of Informa-
tion and Youth, announced in May, 1956, that the campaign had "entirely
destroyed the predominant communist influence of the previous nine years.” 71/
According to his figures, 94,041 former communist cadres had rallied to the
GVN, 5,613 other cadres had surrendered to government forces, 119,954 ©
weapons had been captured, 75 tons of documents, and 7O7 underground arms
caches had been discovered. One Saigon newspaper boldly referred to Tanh's
proceedings as a "puppet show" -- for which it was closed down. What
relationship GVN statistics bore to reality is not known. 7e

However, for many peasants the Anti-Communist Campaign was
considerably more than theatrics. Diem, in a Presidential Ordinance of Janu-
ary 11, 1956, expanded upon an existing system of political re-education
centers for communists and active communist supporters. 73/ ‘The 1956
order authorized the arrest and detention of anyone deemed dangerous to
the safety of the state, and their incarceration in one of several concen-
tration camps. The Secretary of State for Information disclosed in 1956
that 15,000 to 20,000 communists had been in these centers since 1954, a
figure probably low at the time, and undoubtedly raised thereafter. Th /

On May 6, 1959, the GVN promulgated Law 10/59, which stiffened penalties
for communist affiliations, and permitted trial of accused by special
military tribunals. That year Anti-Communist Denunciation was also stepped
up. In 1960, a GVN Ministry of Information release stated that 48,250
persons had been jailed between 1954 and 1960, but a French observer
estimates the numbers in jail at the end of 1956 alone at 50,000. 75/

P. J. Honey, who was invited by Diem to investigate certain of the re-
education centers in 1959, reported that on the basis of his talks
with former inmates, "the consensus of the opinions expressed by these
people is that...the majority of the detainees are neither communists

nor pro-communists." 76/

The Anti-Communist Campaigns targetted city-dwellers, but it
was in the rural areas, where the Viet Minh had been most strong, that it
was applied most energetically. For example, in 1959 the Information Chief
of An Xuyen Province (Cau Mau region) reported that a five week Anti-
Communist Campaign by the National Revolutionary Movement had resulted in
the surrender of 8,125 communist agents, and the denunciation of 9,806
other agents and 29,978 sympathizers. Tt/ To furnish the organization
and spark enthusiasm for such undertakings, Ngo Dinh Nhu organized in
1958 the Republican Youth, which with Madame Nhu's Solidarity Movement,
became a vehicle for rural paramilitary training, political, and intelli-
gence activities. 78 Nhu saw the Republican Youth as a means for bringing
"controlled liberty" to the countryside, and it seems certainly to have
assisted in extending his control.
