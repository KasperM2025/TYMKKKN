but progress will be slowed down,” and General
Wheeler's support of that view. General Wheeler
added, "We won't lose the war, but it will be a longer
one.” It would be based, second, on the fact that no
one argues that the added forces will probably cause
the war to end in less than two years. COURSE B
implies a conviction that neither military defeat nor
military victory is in the cards, with or without the
large added deployments, and that the price of the
large added deployments and the strategy of COURSE A
will be to expand the war dangerously. COURSE B is
designed to improve the negotiating environment within
a limited deployment of US forces by combining continu-
ous attacks against VC/NVA main force units with slow
improvements in pacification (which may follow the new
_ constitution, the national reconciliation proclamation,
our added efforts and the Vietnamese elections this
fall) and a restrained program of actions against the
North.

This alternative would give General Westmoreland
96 maneuver battalions -- an 85 per cent increase in
combat force over the 52 battalions that he had in
Vietnam in June of last year, and 22 per cent more
than the 79 we had there at the beginning of this
year. According to this report, we have already
passed the "cross-over point," where the enemy's
losses exceed his additions; we will soon have in
Vietnam 200,000 more US troops than there are in
enemy main force units. We should therefore, without
added deployments, be able to maintain the military
initiative, especially if US troops in less-essential
missions (such as in the Delta and in pacification
