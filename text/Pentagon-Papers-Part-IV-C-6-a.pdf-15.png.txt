All pacification efforts placed
under MACV. Komer named -Deputy
for Pacification to COMUSMACY.

ASD(ISA) reviews situation in

Vietnam, analyzes alternative mili-
tary courses of action, argues against
force level increases, proposes
strategy of "slow progress."

JCS seriously concerned at the
prospective introduction by the USSR
into NVM of new weapons. Proposed
neutralization of Hanoi-Haiphong
complex by attacking all elements of
the import system of NVN, "shouldering
out" foreign shipping, mining port.
JCS recommend selective callup of
reserves so US could more effectively
fulfill worldwide commitments.

SecDef requested JCS to prepare
detailed study analyzing in depth
CSS staffing levels in SVN.

JCS reply to 26 April memo by DepSecDef.
Concluded that (a) force levels recom-
mended in JCSM 218-67 should be deployed;
(b) a more effective air/naval campaign
against NVN should be conducted as recom-
mended in JCSM 218-67.

Identifies certain factual corrections
and annotations in COMUSMACV 18 March
"minimum essential force" request.

JCS reply to 19 May DPM, expressed
strong objections to basic orientation
as well as specific recommendations

and objectives. Saw "alarming pattern"
which suggested a major realignment of
US objectives and intentions in SEA,
recommended that DPM "not be considered
further.”

JCS response to SecDef memo of 20 May.
Coneluded thet original recommendation
of 20 May represented the most effec-
tive way to prosecute air/naval
campaign against NVN.
