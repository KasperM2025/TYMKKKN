FACED WITH THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING PICTURE OF WASHINGTON DESIRES AND
INTENTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THIRD COUNTRY (AS
WELL AS US) COMBAT FORCES, I BADLY NEED A CLARIFICATION OF OUR PUR-
POSES AND OBJECTIVES, BEFORE I CAN PRESENT OUR CASE TO GVN, I HAVE
TO KNOW WHAT THAT CASE IS AND WHY, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO
GET READY CONCURRENCE FOR THE LARGE SCALE INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN
TROOPS UNLESS THE NEED IS CLEAR AND EXPLICIT,

LET ME SUGGEST THE KIND OF INSTRUCTION TO THE AMB WHICH IT WOULD
BE MOST EELPFUL TO RECEIVE FOR USE IN PRESENTING TO GVN WHAT I
TAKE TO BE A NEW POLICY OF THIRD COUNTRY PARTICIPATION IN GROUND
COMBATs z

QUOTE THE USG HAS COMPLETED A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE SITUATION
IN SVN BOTH IN ITS NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS AND HAS REACHE
CERTAIN IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS, IT FEELS THAT IN RECENT WEEKS THERE

HAS BEEN A SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL SITUATION AS
THE RESULT OF THE AIR ATTACKS ON DRV, THE RELATIVELY SMALL SUT

NUMEROUS SUCCESSES IN THE FIELD AGAINST THE VC AND THE ENCOURAGING

| PROGRESS OF THE QUAT GOVT, HOWEVER, IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY

faEAR THAT, IN ALL PROBABILITY , THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE GVN
{4D THE USC OF CHANGING THE WILL OF Nie DRY TO SUPPORT THE VC

SURGENCY CAN NOT BE ATTAINED IN AN ACCEPTABLE TIME FRAME BY
THE METHODS PRESENTLY EMPLOYED, THE ATR CAMPAIGN IN THE NORTH MUST
BE SUPPLEMENTED BY SIGNAL SUCCESSES AGAINST THE VC IN THE SOUGH
BEFORE WE CAN HOPE TO CREATE THAT FRAME OF MIND IN HANOI WHICH
WILL. LEAD TO THE ep BS WE SEEK, TAYLOR,
