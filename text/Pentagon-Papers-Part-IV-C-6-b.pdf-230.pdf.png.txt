The Acting Chairman (General Johnson) apparently took the Director,
Joint Staff Memorandum to the White House on 12 September. The
nature of the discussion is not known. However, uwpon his return from
the White House, General Johnson indicated that the President desired the
Joint Staff to indicate recommended actions, within present policy limita-
tions, which would increase pressure on North Vietnam. Tt/ Nothing was
said concerning accelerated deployments, and the Joint Staff did not
further consider this subject.

However, on 16 September 1968, in a memorandum to the Secretary of
Defense, the Secretary of the Army indicated that the Army had re-analyzed
its capability to deploy the 101st Airborne Division (-) to Vietnam and
had determined that a brigade task force and a headquarters and control
element of the division (approximately 4,500 personnel) could be deployed
by air to close in Vietnam before Christmas. The remainder of the
division (-) could either deploy by surface to close in Vietnam before
February or could deploy by air in mid to late January 1968 to close
before TET (31 January 1968). 78/

On 22 September, the Secretary of Defense approved the plan to
deploy the brigade task force and headquarters element by air in December
1967, but indicated that a decision on the accelerated deployment of the
remainder of the division would be made at a later date. 79/

In the meantime, on 15 September, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved
and forwarded to the Secretary of Defense the refined troop list for the
“tentatively approved FY 1968 additive forces for South Vietnam and a
civilianization schedule to remain within the specific military personnel
strength ceiling of 525,000." Civilianization, the 525,000 ceiling, plus
Program 4 trade-offs, permitted an additive force structure of 50,978
for FY 1968, which was allocated as follows: Army 39,365; Navy 7,483;
Marine Corps 969; and Air Force 3,161.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff pointed out again, however, that even with

the high civilianization goal, many requirements still could not be accom-
modated.

For example, a Marine Corps requirement for 6,124 spaces
‘plus integral Navy personnel to permit III MAF to be manned at
full strength is not included in the troop list. This require-
ment is based on modification of existing T/Os and augmentations
eaused by the nature of operations being conducted in I CTZ, the
introduction of newer and more sophisticated equipment, and the
expanding functions and responsibilities being assigned to III MAF.
The Marine Corps has indicated that approximately 3,500 of these
additional Marines could be provided by December 1967. Also,
both the Army and Air Force identified additional priority require-
ments that could not be incorporated within ceiling; approximately
