strategy in the South is necessarily defensive, our tac-
tics are decidedly offensive.

Of particular importance General Westmoreland felt was that the
enemy had been refused strategic or significant tactical success:

It has been my objective to frustrate the enemy's _
plans, therefore I have given overriding attention to
maneuvering troops to deny them battlefield successes
and psychological opportunities.

During the past year, the enemy has --

a. Been forced by our naval operations to abandon
plans to bring in large tonnages by sea.

b. Had to resort to use of the long rugged land
supply route through Laos.

ce. Been denied recruits in the numbers required
from the populated areas along the coast, thereby forcing
him to supply manpower form North Vietnam.

d. Been denied rice from the coastal provinces of
I and IIT Corps in the quantities required, thereby forcing
him to transport rice from North Vietnam or to buy rice
from Cambodia. 59/

In summary, COMUSMACV believed that North Vietnam was paying a
tremendous price with nothing to show in return. In his words: "The
situation is not a stalemate; we are winning slowly but steadily and
this pace can accelerate if we reinforce our successes. Therefore, I
believe we should step up our operations in pacification in the south,
increase the pressure in the north, and exercise new initiatives in
Iaos." 60/

The J2 estimate which followed COMUSMACV's overall assessment con-
cluded that:

Overall, the enemy must be having personnel prob-
lems. His losses have been heavy, and his in-country
recruiting efforts unsatisfactory. He is probably
attempting to make good his losses by heavy infiltra-
tion, but we cannot conclusively prove this, nor do we
know how successful he has been. We hear frequently of
