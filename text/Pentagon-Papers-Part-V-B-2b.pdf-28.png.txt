157. The U.S. recounts the doubts and distrust remaining on the
subject of colonialism in Indochina but maintains that the
real issue is whether or not the Indochinese people will
be allowed to exercise sovereignty or be subjected to com-
munist terror. Dean Rusk Address, 6 November 1951.......... 459

158. France requests that conversation take place immediately
between U.S., U.K. and France concerning concerted action
in the event of seemingly imminent Chinese intervention in
Indochina. Bruce (Paris) 3765 to Acheson, 22 December 1951. 460

159. France delivers an aide-memoire to the U.S. on a proposal
to appeal to the U.N. if Red China intervenes. Paris 3856

160. Acheson reviews tripartite military discussions in which
State did not participate. General Bradley, while unable
to commit or indicate the extent of U.S. military assis-
tance in the event of CHICOM invasion, would recommend to
the President that a declaration be issued to Red China
that retaliation would follow any aggression. Acheson 974

161. The NSC considers the consequences to the United States of

communist domination of Southeast Asia. Loss of Southeast

Asia is seen as putting economic and political pressures

on Japan, Opening sources of strategic materials to the

Soviet Bloc, rendering the U.S. position in the Pacific

precarious and jeopardizing lines of communication and
trade routes to South Asia. If Red China intervenes, the

U.S. should take appropriate military action as part of a

U.N. action or in conjunction with others but not unilater-

ally. Amnex to NSC Tet, 13 February 1952s.ccccssevcececosee 468

162. The CIA estimates that a joint warning against CHICOM inter-
vention in Southeast Asia would tend to deter them, that
initiation of action in the U.N. would probably bring a
response similar to that regarding Korea, and CHICOM defi-
ance of a joint warning would probably involve prior consent
of the USSR. CIA Special Estimate, SE-22, 29 February 1952. 477

163. The JCS views on NSC 124 and Annex to NSC 124 are that mili-
tary operations in defense of Indochina against Chinese
Communist invasion must be accompanied by action against
Communist China itself -- a course of action which might
result in a long and expensive war, and that from a military
point of view, the JCS oppose acceptance of all the military
commitments of NSC 124. JCS Memorandwn for the SecDef
(forwarded to the National Security Council), 3 March 1952.. 486
