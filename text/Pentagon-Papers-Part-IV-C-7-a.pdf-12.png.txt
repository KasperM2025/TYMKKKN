The POL order is reinstated
for 29 June.

At long last the POL facilities
are struck with initially
highly positive damage reports.

After having been briefed by
CINCPAC on the effects of the
POL strikes to date, McNamara
informs Admiral Sharp that the
President wants first priority
given to strangulation of the
NVN POL system.

RT 51 specifies a program for
intensive attacks on POL as
ist priority.

As a part of a comprehensive

attack on POL storage, Sharp

recommends attacks on Kep and
Phuc Yen airfields.

70% of NVN's large bulk POL
storage capacity has been
destroyed along with 7% of its
dispersed storage.

NVN was using the POL attacks
as @ lever to extract more aid
from the Chinese and the Soviets.

General Westmoreland spends two
days at the ranch conferring with
the President on the progress of
the war and new troop requirements

CINCPAC emphatically opposes
any â€˜standdown, pause or reduc-
tion in the air war.

IDA's JASON Division submits
four reports on the war done by
a special study group of top
scientists who stress the inef-
fectiveness of the bombing,
including POL, and recommend the
construction of an anti-infiltra-
tion barrier across northern
South Vietnam and Laos.
