THE STAGE IS SET FOR "BETTER GVN RECEPIIVITY"

While the U.S. groped for a better way to determine how the counter-
insurgent effort was going and debated how (or if) to exercise leverage
against Diem, it was overtaken by events. The 1963 Buddhist crisis in
RVN was met by increasingly repressive measures by the GVN. These
developments finally led the U.S, to reassess its support for Diem and to
consider other non-communist alternatives to his leadership. On
1 November 1963 Diem was overthrow by a military coup d'etat. The
pacification effort organized around the Strategic Hamlet Program died
with him; the advisory effort was left untouched in terms of size and
scope. To the extent that Diem and his family were the ones preventing
ARVN from meeting the expectations of late 1961, it wes reasoned, now was
the time for the military advisory system to begin to function more
effectively. To the extent that ARVN commanders in the field had been
unresponsive to U.S. advice because of indifference and opposition in the
Gia Long Palace, it was hoped the difficulties of the past might be
rectified by the new military regime.
