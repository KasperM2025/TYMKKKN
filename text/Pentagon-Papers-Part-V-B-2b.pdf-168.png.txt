(6) French at present are in no position initiate
counter-offensive to drive Viet Minh to northern border, nor
will then be in predictable future in view of increasing Viet
Minh strength, unless additional trained troops are brought
epee France or its possessions,

| (7) Viet Minh activities Cambodia and Laos as well as
Vietnam are increasing and no troops can be spared from these
areas or operations in Tonkin,

(8) Formation of Vietnamese Army is still under discus-
sion, and not likely to become consolidated force within a
year, and will not have any appreciable military value before
1952 except possibly as police force in pacification areas,
Conclusions are based on assumption that Chinese Communists
will not openly participete in Viet Minh operations and
immediate military aid requested in Legtel 566, October 16
will arrive by 1 January 1951,

Extremely fast-moving political situation in Indochina presents
many complications for French Mylitary Command. Current plans of
French military here are at present still dependent on contro-
versial negotiations and political decisions which must be made
guickly, and the military is being delayed in implementing their
current plans. Three main questions at this time are:

(A) Decision which must yet be made as to changing the
â€˜mission of military in Tonkin entirely from pacification to
direct operational,

(B) Manner and speed with which Vietnamese Army will be
activated, ;

(C) Speed with which military air will be delivered,
Current French plans will be successful only if these ques-
tions are resolved successfully without delay.

Participated in conference with Juin and have discussed sit-
uation and plans with Carpentier here, Allessandri in Hanoi, and
chiefs of major forces. General Valluy, Juin assistant, has re-
mained here with him and I have had similar discussion with him,
