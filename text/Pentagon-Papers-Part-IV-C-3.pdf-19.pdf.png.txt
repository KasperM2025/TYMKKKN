DESCRIPTION

Army Chief of Staff, Gen. H.K.
Johnson, tours Vietnam on a mis-

‘sion for the President,

Two Marine Battalion Landing Teams
are ordered to Da Nang by the Presi-
dent to take up base security func-
tions in the Da Nang perimeter.

The two Marine battalions land at
Da Nang and set up defensive posi-
tions.

Taylor expresses sharp annoyance at
what seemsto him an unnecessarily
timid and ambivalent U.S. stance on
air strikes, The long delay between
strikes, the marginal weight of the
attacks, and the great ado about
diplomatic feelers were weakening
our signal to the North, He calls
for a more dynamic schedule of
strikes, amiltiple week program re-
lentlessly marching North to break
Hanoi's will.

U Thant proposes a conference of the
big powers with North and South
Vietnam to start preliminary nego-
tiations,.

The U.S. rejects Thant's proposal
until the DRV stops its aggression,

The President lifts the restriction
on the use of napalm in strikes on
the North, and eliminates the re-
quirement for Vietnamese co-pilots
in FARMGATE missions,

In a memo to SecDef with preliminary
reports on U.S. aircraft losses in
hostilé action, Wheeler requests
better ordnance, more recce, and
greater fieid command flexibility in

' alternate target selection for

weather problems.
