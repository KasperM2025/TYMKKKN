There would be two reserve callups to meet and sustain these deploy-
ments, one in March and one in May. The callup in March would support
the 30,000 deployment. The one in May would reconstitute the strategic
reserve at seven active divisions. Other ground rules decided upon were:
(1) those Reservists to be called in May would not now be notified; (2)
there would be no extensions of terms of service for personnel presently
on active duty; (3) no individuals would be recalled, only units. 83/

This decision was formalized by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in a
memorandum to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 14 March 1968.
Mr. Nitze asked the chairman to inform General Westmoreland of these pro-
posals, and to ask him whether he considered the substitutions satisfactory. 8h/

On 14 March, the Secretary of the Army forwarded to the Secretary of
Defense his recommendations concerning these Program Six deployments, and
the Reserve callup necessary to sustain them and to reconstitute the
strategic reserve. Secretary Resor pointed out, however, that an addi-
tional 13,500 men would have to be added to the figure of 30,000 to be
deployed. "If the 3d Brigade of the 82nd Airborne is to be left in-country
permanently and if the Army is to replace the RLT with an infantry brigade
on a permanent basis then units with TO&E strength of 13,500 must be
ineluded in the March 15 call-up and deployed....In addition, the MACV
ceiling will have to be increased from 565,000 to 578,500, unless MACV can
provide trade-off spaces for all or part of this add-on." 85/

The strength of units to be called up in March would be 45,000, as
follows:

a. Units to provide for the additional deployments - 31,563.

b. Units to provide the sustaining troops for 82d Airborne
and RLT 27 replacement - 13,437.

The May 15 callup would comprise the following:

1 division plus 1 IST 32,000
1 brigade 4,000

Post, camp and station comple-
ment to open 1 additional station 5,000
Total 71,000

This would reconstitute the STRAF at the following levels:
