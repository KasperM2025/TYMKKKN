DESCRIPTION

The VC launch a mortar attack on the
Bien Hoa airfield that kilis Americans
and damages aircraft. The military
recommend 4 reprisal against the North;
the President refuses.

Iyndon Johnson is re-elected President
with a crushing majority.

At the President's request, W.P. Bundy
heads an inter-agency Task Force for
an in-depth review of US Vietnam policy
and options. The work goes on through-
out the month.

The Bundy Task Force submits its draft
eonclusions to the Principals. They
propose three alternative courses of
action: (1) continuation of current
policy with no escalation and a resis-
tance to negotiations; (2) a signifi-
cant set of pressures against the North
accompanied by vigorous efforts to start
negotiations; (3) a modest campaign
against the North with resistance to
negotiations.

The NSC Principals reject the pure form
of any of the recommendations and
instead substitute a two-phase recon-
mendation for the President: the first
phase is a slight intensification of
current covert activities against the
North and in Laos, the second after

30 days would be a moderate campaign

of air strikes against the DRV.

The President, in a meeting with the
NSC Principals, and Taylor, who returned
on 23 November, hears the latter's re-

-port on the grave conditions in SVN,

then approves Phase I of the proposal.
He gives tentative approval to Phase II
but makes it contingent on improvement
by the GV.

In a last meeting with Taylor, the Presi-

dent stresses the need to get action
from the GVN before Phase II.
