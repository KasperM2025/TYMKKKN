TOP SECRET - Sensitive

Excerpt from The Bitter Heritage, 1967, by Arthur M. Schlesinger

Pages 75-76

Â«--The two heaviest blows recently suffered. by Peking -- the destruction
of the Communist Party in Indonesia and the declaration of independence by
North Korea -- took place without benefit of American patronage or rhetoric.
Indeed, too overt American intervention may actually have the effect of
smothering the forces of local nationalism or driving them to the other
side and thereby ultimately weakening the containment of China.

In the unpredictable decades ahead, the most effective bulwark against
an aggressive national communist state in some circumstances may well be
national communism in surrounding states. A rational policy of containing
China could have recognized that a communist Vietnam under Ho might be a
better instrument of containment than a shaky Saigon regime led. by right-
wing mandarins or air force generals. Had Ho taken over all Vietnam in
1954, he might today be soliciting Soviet support to strengthen his re-
sistance to Chinese pressure, and this situation, however appalling for
the people of South Vietnam, would obviously be better for the United States
than the one in which we are floundering today. And now, alas, it may be
almost too late: the whole thrust of United States policy since 1954,
and more than ever since the bombing of the north began, has been not to
pry Peking and Hanoi apart but to drive them together.
