Lodge defers
departure

Lodge and Felt meet
with Diem

xxviii

DESCRIPLION

The White House is now genuinely
concerned at the Saigon dispute
and tells Lodge it believes

we still have the power to

call off the coup if we choose
to.

Lodge replies to Washington

that he is powerless to stop
the coup, the matter is en-

tirely in Vietnamese hands.

Harkins does not concur.

To clear the air and redefine
U.S. policy, Washington sent
another cable to Lodge. The
U.S. cannot accept as a policy
position that it has no power
to prevent the coup. If the
coup does not have high pros-
pects of success, Lodge should
intercede with the generals

to have it delayed or called
off. More detailed informa-
tion on the plans is urgently
requested. Specific instruc-
tions to guide U.S. action
during a coup are issued.

They prescribe strict non-
involvement and somewhat less
strict neutrality.

Lodge, who had been scheduled
to leave for Washington for
high-level conferences, defers
his departure because of the
tense atmosphere and the appar-
ent imminence of the coup.

Admiral Felt, who is visiting,
and Ledge call on Diem, who
reiterates many of the points
he made to McNamara, a month
earlier. At the end of the
meeting, Diem takes Lodge aside
and indicates he is ready to
talk about what the U.S. wants
