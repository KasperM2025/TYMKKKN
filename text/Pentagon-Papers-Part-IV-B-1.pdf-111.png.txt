than with how he came out as chief warrior for a legislative program.

From Laos to Cuba to Vienna to Berlin to the Soviet nuclear
testing site at Semipalatinsk to New York's East River, crisis after
erisis has fallen across the White House with a rapidity and gravity
that has absorbed Mr. Kennedy's energy since his inauguration and
reduced the Congressional program to secondary importance. 23/

And a couple of days later, James Reston, describing the imminent risk
nuclear crisis over Berlin, reported:

Specifically, Khrushchev told one of Mr. Kennedy's political
emissaries that once Krushchev signs a separate peace treaty with
the Communist East Germans, not only all of the West's rights in
Berlin will cease, but all traffic to Berlin will cease until the
West negotiates new rights of access with thé East German regime.

Khrushchev was questioned minutely on this key point. His reply
was unequivocal: Not one truck, or barge, or train, or plane would
leave from West Germany for West Berlin after the separate peace
treaty until the new arrangements with the East Germans were
negotiated.

Now, this is not precisely the same as Mr. Gromyko’s bland assur-
ances. This is blockade, and blockade is an act of war. Washington
has made clear that it is not going to get stirred up if the East
Germans merely replace the Russians on the borders between Hast and
West Germany and approve the flow of adequate supplies. But Mr. Khrush-
chev did not support this procedure, and went on to threaten that any
effort to break his blockade by force would lead to war. ah/

Since Khrushchey had repeatedly pledged to sign the East German treaty by
the end of the year, the showdown was not far off.
