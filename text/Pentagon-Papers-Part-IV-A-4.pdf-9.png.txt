generated in Saigon, Diem carrying his position to the highest
levels of the agency of. his choice, while U.S. representatives
had to seek protagonists at various levels within their own
agencies. The implications for U.S. policy in the field are
obvious.

Because of the divisions and diversions inherent in the above,
U.S.. aid in the period up to 1960 failed to produce an effective
counterinsurgent force either within the National Army, or in the
paramilitary organizations. This is not to imply that had resources
been diverted from the creation of a conventional army to that of an
effective counterinsurgent force the problem of Vietnam would have been
solved, for the enemy has demonstrated both versatility and flexibility
that would render such a statement vacuous. It is to suggest, however,
that given the world situation in the period of relevance and the
situation in Southeast Asia, it seems likely that the DRV, whatever
- strategic alternative it might have elected to follow, would not have
been deterred from overt aggression by any army of Vietnam it was
within U.S.-GVN capability to create. An effective counterinsurgent
force, on the other hand, might have limited its choices; might well
have prevented effective prosecution of the guerrilla alternative
the Viet Cong and the DRV did elect to follow.

So TOP SECRET - Sensitive
