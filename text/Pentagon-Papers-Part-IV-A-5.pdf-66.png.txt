with certainty much further concerning the quality or quantity of

Bloc aid during this period. Reports of the presence in North Vietnam
of Soviet-design small arms, artillery, tanks, and trucks were received
regularly by U.S. intelligence, but the proportion of these which were
supplied by the Chinese could not be established. U.S. estimates held
that Soviet aid predominated up until about 1960, and that thereafter
Hanoi looked increasingly to Peking for supply of such items, as well

as for ammunition of all types. 90 By 1964, except for some remaining
stocks of French weapons, all NVA mortars and recoilless rifles were
reported to be of Chinese manufacture. Similarly, small arms such as

SKS 7.62 mm rifles and K-53 and K-54 7.62 mm machine guns, though of
Russian design, were thought to have been supplied by China. For heavier,
more complex items (e.g., armored vehicles, heavy artillery, antiaircraft
systems, aircraft, and the like), the DRV remained dependent on the
Soviets.

3. The French Arms

In South Vietnam, the most significant military develop-
ment in the immediate aftermath of Geneva was the withdrawal of the
200,000 men of the French Expeditionary Corps by 1956, apparently
removing with them an estimated $200 million worth of undetermined
kinds of military equipment from $1,308 million in MDAP materiel fur-
nished them by the United States during the period 1950-1954. How
precisely this draw-down affected the ceilings envisaged by Articles
16 and 17 of the Agreement was, of course, never established. 91/ The
attention of the DRV and the ICC thereafter was fixed on the Republic of
Vietnam's Armed Forces (RVNAF), and upon the United States military
assistance program for RVNAF.

hk. RVNAF Revitalized

The French brought the Vietnamese Army into being in 1948,
its strength in 1949 being reported as 25,000, led by French officers
and noncommissioned officers. 92/ That strength rose eight-fold during
the war, to 50,000 in 1950; 65,800 in 1951; 150,000 in 1953; and 200,000
in 1954, including 1500 navy and 3500 air-force personnel. Dien Bien Phu
and its aftermath resulted in widespread desertions, especially from
Vietnamese units being moved from north to south during the regroupment. 93/
Thereafter, under urging from the U.S., French officers and noncommissioned
leaders were withdrawn, and a combined U.S.-French training mission was
established to develop the national army. New force structures for mili-
tary and paramilitary forces evolved, with particular emphasis upon head-
guarters, staffs, and logistic units. Strengths for the Republic of
Vietnam Armed Forces (RVNAF), for the same years given above for DRV
armed forces, were as follows:
