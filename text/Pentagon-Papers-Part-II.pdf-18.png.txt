"At proper time and under proper circumstances Department
will be_prepared [to/ do its part by extending recognition
[to the/ Bao Dai Government and by exploring /the/ possibility
of complying with any request by_such a Government for U.S.
arms and economic assistance. [Tt must be understood, however,
[that/ aid program this nature would require Congressional
approval. Since U.S. could scarcely afford backing if a
government which would have color [of, » and be likely /to suffer
the/ fate opie [ a/ puppet regime, it must first be clear that
France will offer all necessary concessions to make Bao Dai
solution attractive to nationalists.

"tis is / a_/ step of which French themselves must see
urgency /and/ necessity /in/ view possibly short time _
remaining before Commie successes /in/ China are felt [in]
Indochina. Moreover, Bao Dai Government must through own
efforts demonstrate capacity [to organize and conduct affairs
wisely so as to ensure maximum opportunity of obtaining
requisite popular support, inasmuch as /any/ government
created in Indochina analogous /to the/ Kuomintang would be
foredoomed failure. ,

"Assuming essential French concessions are forthcoming,
best chance /of/ success /for/ Bao Dai would appear to be
in persuading Vietnamese nationalists:

(1) their patriotic aims may be realized promptly
through French-Bao Dai agreement :

(2) Bao Dai government will be truly representative
even to the extent of including outstanding
non-Commie leaders now supporting Ho, and

(3) Bao Dai solution [is the/ only means [ot] ay
safeguarding Vietnam from aggressive designs [of
the/ Commie Chinese."

Through 19h9, the southward march of Mao's legions continued,
and the Viet Minh were obviously preparing to establish relations with
them. :

b. Recognition, 1950

The Elysee Agreements were eleven months old before the
U.S. considered tnat France had taken the concrete steps toward Vietnamese
autonomy which the U.S. had set as conditions for recognizing Bao Dai.
In late January, 1950, events moved swiftly. Ho Chi Minh announced that
his was the "only legal government of the Vietnam people” and indicated
DRV willingness to cooperate with any nation willing to recognize it on
the basis of "equality and mutual respect of national sovereignty and
territory." Mao responded promptly with recognition, followed by Stalin.
