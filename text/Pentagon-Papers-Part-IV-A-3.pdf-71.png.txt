USFOTO 263 to Paris end Saigon, 24 Nov 54 (S); (Ely and Collins' strong
recommendation that the FEC be maintained in Vietnam overcame reser-
vations of military and diplomatic leaders in Washington that it be
withdraw. Washington's reasoning: civil war, not overt aggression,
threatened Vietnam -= and the FEC wovld not be used in a civil conflict;
the immediate US objectives of restoring order in Vietnam and bolstering
Diem were not furthered by the presence of French troops. Therefore,
the FEC is not worth the cost of its upkeep.)

111757zZFeb55 (C). Franco-American cooperation often missing in other
endeavors was fairly good in TRIM. Intrigues between French end U.S.
personnel and French intrigues against Diem existed~-but their
interference with the task of directing and developing the VNA was
not as great as it might have been. Even Lansdale--hardly an avid
French supporter-.says: "there was a job to be done", and credits some
French officers for their competence and cooperating in doing the job.
