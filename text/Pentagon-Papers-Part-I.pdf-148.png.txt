A Cochinchinese faction which splintered
from the Viet Minh over quarrels with Viet
Minh leaders. Included Cao Dai, Hoa Hao,
and Binh Xuyen leaders, and participated
in the National Union Front. Party frac-

the regions governed by the Cao Dai. ‘The
Cao Dai were divided on the issue of French

signed a peace with the Hoa Hao, and pledged

Another Cochinchinese armed sect with a
following of 200,000 to 1,000,000. During
World War II the sect, with Japanese support,
