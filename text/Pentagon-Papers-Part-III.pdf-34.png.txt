Eisenhower's unwavering attitude toward action in Asia only in
concert with allies put him at odds with Dulles, who was prepared.
to act unilaterally at least in circumstances of overt aggression.
When the issue of possible CPR air intervention came before the
President, he is reported to have reacted sharply. Evidently
supposing that conflict in the air would mean a Sino-U.S. war,

the President said the United States would not intervene in China
on any basis except united action. He would not be responsible
for going into China alone unless a joint Congressional resolu-
tion ordered him to do so. The United States should in no event
undertake alone to support French colonialism. Unilateral action
by the United States in cases of this kind would destroy us.

If we intervened: alone in this case, we would be expected to inter-
vene alone in other parts of the world, He made very plain that
the need. for united action as a condition of U.S. intervention
was not related merely to the regional grouping for the defense of
Southeast Asia but was also a necessity for U.S. intervention in
response to Chinese Communist overt aggression.

Yet, when reminded by his Special Assistant, Robert Cutler,
of NSC 5405's position that U.S. unilateral action could not be
ruled out in the event of overt Chinese aggression against Thailand,
Burma, or Malaya, and of Dulles' September 2, 1953 warning to
China of a direct U.S. response to Chinese aggression in Indochina,
the President stated that no difference existed between himself
and Dulles. (Memorandum of conversation between Fisenhower and
Cutler, June 1, 1954, TOP SECRET).
