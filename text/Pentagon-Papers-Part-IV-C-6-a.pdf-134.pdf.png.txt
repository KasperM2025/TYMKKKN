I have not denied any funding request necessary to conduct the war
and which can be effectively utilized during the current fiscal year.
The FY67 supplemental and F¥68 budgets have been designed to meet
war needs through the FY68 funding leadtime. If the tempo of the conflict
increases beyond the level now planned, additional funds will be required.
The recommended Southeast Asia deployments and supporting supplemental
budget requests are in accord with the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
‘with the exceptions noted later.

To date, we have met virtually all of COMUSMACV's requirements for
maneuver battalions at or near the time he requested them, without recall

of the Reserves or withdrawals of units deployed to Burope or other her key

overseas areas. Moreover, we still have the capability to deploy addi- addi-

tional active forces as well as a large ready force wherever r they _may
be needed.

The decision to retain the organized reserve as a reserve led to a
requirement to organize certain units that were not available in the
CONUS active forces. With only a few exceptions, we have deployed then
as required and on a schedule quite close to what we could have expected
under a reserve mobilization. Many of the units that could not be pro-
vided as required (e.¢., aviation units) were not available in the reserve
structure either. The table below compares the current plan with the
deployment schedule that the JCS lest March estimated could be met if
the reserve forces had been called to active duty.

a/ Case I, CINCPAC Capabilities Conference, 12 February 1966.

U.S. forces in SEA have performed exceedingly well. In the summer
of 1965 NVA forces threatened to destroy the SVN armed forces and achieve
@ military victory. The introduction of U.S. forces almost completely
neutralized the vc/NVA large units. He has lost 114,000 troops in the
last year, including invaluable cadre. The B-52 and tactical air effort
has hurt enemy morale, produced casualties, and disrupted his operations
and logistics operations. It is our success to date that permits the
analysis in the next section of the incremental value of still more
deployments.
