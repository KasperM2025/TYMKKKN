infer from either Course of Action 2 or Course of Action 3 that the U.S.
was determined to fight on alone. That possibility was outweighed in his
eyes, however, by the tactical benefits to be gained plus the guarantee
of a "more orderly buildup" than could have been the case under Course

of Action 1.

In regard to the build-up of the RVNAF, MACV had in late 1964
two alternative proposals under discussion. Alternative 1 called for
increases of 30,309 in the regular forces, plus 35,387 in the Regional
Force and 10,815 in the Popular Force. Alternative 2 called for the
same increases in RF/PF but for an accelerated figure for the regular
forces of 47,556. Taking into account the limited leadership resources
available to the GVN and the restricted training facilities, General
Westmoreland in January 1965 recommended the more modest Alternative 1
build-up for Military Assistance Program funding. The Secretary of
Defense approved the recommended increases on 23 January, thereby bring-
ing the MAP supported RVNAF to levels. of 275,058 for the regulars, plus
137,187 for RF and 185,000 for PF. 108/

In response to COMUSMACV's Estimate of the Situation of March
1965 and a memorandwm from the Joint Chiefs which followed it, the
Secretary of Defense approved the accelerated Alternative 2 force level
for the regulars and authorized MAP fimding for an additional 17,247
spaces in RVNAF on 12 April 1965. Also provided was an increase in the
MACV JID of 160 spaces for advisors to work with the enlarged RVNAF.109/

In late May, the JCS asked the Secretary of Defense to authorize
MAP support for another 2,369 spaces for ARVN. The purpose was to fatten
out a division base for the eventual organization of a tenth ARVN division
from existing separate regiments. 110/ The request was approved on the
ith of June. 111/

Any further plans to build up the RVNAF were torpedoed by the
extremely heavy losses suffered in combat during late May and early June.
On 7 June, General Westmoreland told CINCPAC and Washington that a
moratorium on RVNAF build-up was unavoidable as any trainees in the pipe-
line would heve to be used as fillers in existing units. No new ARVN
battalions would be coming on the scene until November of that year. 112/

General Westmoreland was not in attendanceâ€™ at the NSC meetings
of 1-2 April 1965. Having gone on record in his Estimate in favor of
the earliest possible input of up to two division equivalents of U.S.
forces, he was wnderstandably disappointed with the very modest increases
sanctioned by the President. He communicated to CINCPAC his concern that,
while he understood that divisions were not immediately in the offing, he
nevertheless felt a pressing need for a division in the highlands. 113/
