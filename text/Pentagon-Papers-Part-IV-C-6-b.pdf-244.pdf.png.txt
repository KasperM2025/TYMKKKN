Study on Binh Chanh, dtd 4 Jul 67.

Discussion concerning adding an additional rifle company to 33
battalions already deployed had persisted since early May when
Secretary McNamara questioned the Secretary of the Army about the
seventy battalions in Program 4 and discovered that approximately
30 had moved with only three companies. If this was so, he asked
should not a fourth be added? (SecDef Control No. X-2637, Memoran-
dum for the Secretary of the Army from the Secretary of Defense,
dtd 2 May 67.)

Secretary of the Army, Stanley R. Resor, replied that
according to the Army there remained 33 airborne infantry or air-
mobile infantry battalions in or approved for deployment to the
Republic of Vietnam for which a fourth rifle company had not been
approved. He subsequently recommended that a fourth company be
added to these 33 battalions. To provide and sustain this increase
in capability he projected that an increase of 7,903 spaces in the
Army trained military strength would be required. Of this, 5,577
were required for the companies themselves and 3,326 were for the
sustaining base. After detailed deliberation, however, McNamara
disapproved the request stating that although he was "inclined to
approve the deployment of these companies it. would not be possible
to find space trade-offs for the 5,577 personnel involved." (Memo
for SecDef, Subj: Program 4 Strength Increases, dated 20 May 67,

for South Vietnam, dated 15 Jun 67.)
