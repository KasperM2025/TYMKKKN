3. Balance of Trade

From 1906 until the war Indochina had a favorable balarice of
trade except in 1923, 1931, and 1932. The balance has now sharply
changed and from January to October 1948 imports were valued at 1,764
million piastres and exports only 926, a deficit of 838 million.‚Äù The
foreign exchange problem is thus acute, particularly as concerns dol-
Jars. The deficit has been made up by France under the plan for the
French Union. The failure to include Indochina for direct allotments
under the Marshall Plan resulted in considerable delay in the 1948
Plan, and it is only in recent weeks that certain dollar allotments
have been approved. Most imports from the United States in 1948 were
delayed shipments under the 197 Plan.

The ambitious ten year plan for the reconstruction and equip-
ment of Indochina foresees large investments of capital. The present
administrators of the plan expect most of this capital to come from
government sources, and there is little place for private capital,
either French or foreign. It is probable that present plans will
have to be considerably modified to fit the new political conditions
now developing.

h, Finance and Currency

Internal finances are in relatively good shape in spite of the
critical foreign exchange problem, The central government has derived
its chief income from customs fees, excise taxes and monopolies, of
which the opium monopoly is the most lucrative. Subsidies were granted
to provincial governments from the central budget.

During the past year a number of changes have taken place in
preparation for the new political organization, The bank note monopoly
has been taken from the powerfulBanque de 1'Indochine and is being
transferred to a new Emission Institute. A separate Indochinese
Treasury has been authorized, while the revenues from the excise taxes
and monopolies were technically transferred to the Associated States
on January 1, 1949. All these measures contemplate a closely knit
economic federation for Indochina in which French participation and
influence will be prominent. The individual states, particularly the
Vietnam, are strongly opposed to this, and lengthy and bitter disputes
with the French on economic and financial matters can be anticipated.

{he Indochinese piastre was worth 10 francs from 1934 until
1946 when the rate was changed to 17. The rate of 6.95 piastres per
dollar became 12.55 as a result of the French devaluation of January
1948, In October 1948 the system of a double exchange rate was ex-
tended to Indochina, the official rate remaining at 12.55 per dollar
and the "free" rate fluctuating with the free franc. Current quotations
are about 19 per dollar. Foreign trade transactions take place at the
average of the two rates or about 15.70. The black market rate rose
during 1948 from around 40 to about 55 per dollar. Even better rates
are occasionally reported from Hong Kong and Bangkok.

De COSst

* It is difficult to convert these figures to dollars due to two
devaluations during the period. Foreign trade is now conducted at
about 15.7 piastres per dollar, the average between the official
rate of 12,55 and the free rate of about 19.
