DESCRIPTION

Diem extends an invitation
to Lodge and his wife to spend
Sunday, Oct 27, with him at
his villa in Dalat. Lodge is
pleased, Diem has come to him.

Conein meets with Don in the
morning and the latter reports
that Harkins had corrected his
previous remarks and apologized
for any misunderstanding.

The coup is set to take place
before Nov 2 and he will meet
Conein later that day to re-
view the plans.

In the evening, Don tells Conein
that the coup committee voted
not to reveal any plans because
of concern about security

leaks. He promises to turn

ever to Conein for Lodge's

Eyes Only the operation plan
two days before the coup occurs.

The UN fact-finding team arrives
in Saigon and begins its in-
vestigation.

Lodge argues that the time has
come to go ahead with a coup
and we should not thwart the
maturing plot. He takes strong
exception to Harkins reserva-
tions about the determination
and ability of the plotters

to carry off the coup.

Bundy, replying for the White
House, is concerned about the
dangers of U.S. support for

a coup that fails. We must

be in a position to judge the
prospects for the coup plan
and discourage any effort with
likelihood of failure.
