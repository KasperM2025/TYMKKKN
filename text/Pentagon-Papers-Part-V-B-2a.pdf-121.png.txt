clear that with a different French commander at Maiphong than
Colonel Debes, who is notorious for graft and brutality and who has
admitted that he cannot control his own troops, the trouble might have
been confined to the original incidents.

According to the French, the Vietnamese enlarge their claims after
each agreement and are so impractical and doctrinaire that all con-
versations are ineffectual. The Vietnamese feel that the French
renege on ench agreement and are trying to reestablish control. THow-
ever, both say they have approximately the same objectives, although
Giap says Vietnam opposes a political Indochinese federation but
favors a federation dealing with common economic problems. Moffat
has mentioned to the French three apparent basie troubles: (#) com-
plete mutual distrust, (4) failure of the French to resolve their own
views on “free state within French Union’, (e) almost childish Vietna-
mese attitude and knowledge of economic questions and vague grop-
ing for “independence”. Agreement cannot be reached by trying to
reach accords on incidental problenis. Basie Vietnam powers and
relations with France must first be established. Not only new faces
are needed bnt neutral good offices er even mediation may be essential.
