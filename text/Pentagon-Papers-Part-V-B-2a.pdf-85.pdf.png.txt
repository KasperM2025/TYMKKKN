Mr, Achesont
As you know we have been following a policy by which
we will not permit the French to buy armament and military
maintenance supplies for use in Indochina, The British
military authorities in Indochina have now asked permission
to turn over to the Freneh some 800 jeeps and trucks which
had been given to the British under Lend-Lease, and which
are now in Indochina. The British state that the French
must have this equipment so that they can maintain order
in Indochina when they have taken over from the British.
Our own military authorities have recommended approval of
the British request. The French, and no doubt the British
also, will be very much upset if we refuse to permit this
transfer. However, in the light of our recently adopted
policy wé may be subjecting ourselves to criticism if we
permit this transfer for the purposes stated, 1.e.,
maintenance of order. ; ;

I would appreciate having your diréétion a&“to the
response which we should make to the military.

I discussed this with the President who thought that
we should agre? to the transfer. He pointed out that this
does not bring any new equipment into the area and that
to remove the trucks and jeeps would be impracticable,
