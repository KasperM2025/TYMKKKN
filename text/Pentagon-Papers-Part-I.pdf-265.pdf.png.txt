After “offer of interference (intervention?)" made by Mr. John
Carter Vincent, people of Vietnam enthusiastically welcomed President
Truman's address of October 28, 1945 in which he set forth the principles
of self-determination and equality of status laid down in Atlantic and
San Francisco Charters. Since then, French have greatly increased their
fighting forces with result that millions will suffer, thousands will
die and invaluable properties will be destroyed unless United States
intervenes to stop bloodshed and unlawful aggression.

On behalf of people and Govt of Indochina, he requests President's
intervention for an immediate solution of Vietnamese issue. People of
Vietnam earnestly hope that the great American Republic will help them
achieve full independence and support them in their reconstruction work.

Thus, with assistance of China and United States, in capital and
technique, Vietnam Republic will be able to contribute her share to
building up world peace and prosperity.

Another letter was received addressed to General Marshall which
is identical with one addressed to President, except that opening para-
graph extends Ho Chi-Minh's congratulations to General Marshall on his
appointment to China and expressed conviction that an understanding of
real situation in Vietnam can make some small contribution to task in
China which confronts him.
