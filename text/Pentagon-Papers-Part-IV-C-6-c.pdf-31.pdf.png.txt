The working group within ISA had access to all of these documents.
In addition, and at the request of the working group, other papers were
prepared within the Department of Defense by the Assistant Secretary
(Systems Analysis) and the Assistant Secretary (Public Affairs).

Initially, Systems Analysis undertook a capability study in order
to: determine if the MACV requirement could indeed be met. They concluded
that, with the exception of Army aviation units, the MACV manpower request
could be filled essentially as desired. This could even be done, the
analysis concluded, without changing the one-year tour policy, without
drawing down on Europe, and without widespread second tours with less than
2. months in CONUS. This assumed a reserve recall, added funds, and the
required strength increases.

Our maximum capability would be to provide 6 maneuver
battalions in May, 9 more in June, 9 in July and as many as
6 more in August -- faster than the MACV request. These
units would have the necessary artillery, transportation
and engineer support. Added tactical air units could deploy
on a matching schedule.

The only significant shortfall would be in Army Aviation.
Even with a reserve recall, present deployment schedules cannot
be significantly accelerated. Production limitations are such
that at least one year would be required to increase the out-
put of UH-1/AF-1 helicopters. Thus, it would be mid-1969
before any added aviation units could deploy and mid-1971
before the total MACV requirement could be met. 3h/

This SA paper also considered several other deployment options, as
follows: cut 50,000 from present authorization; no increase in current
authorization; increase by 50,000; increase by 100,000; increase by 200,000.
The units required under all these options, it was concluded, could deploy
+o Vietnam in a matter of months. The 50,000 man package could arrive in
May and June; the 100,000 man package by August; and the full 200,000 (with
minor exceptions ) by December. The principal exceptions under all options
would continue to be Army aviation units. A summary of the various options
considered is shown below:
