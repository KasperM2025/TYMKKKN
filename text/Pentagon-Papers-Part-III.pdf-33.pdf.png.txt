Dillon tel. from Paris No. 4287 to Dulles, May 10, 1954 (TOP SECRET).

In forwarding these conditions to the Embassy for transmittal to
the French, Dulles noted that a prompt, favorable decision would

be premature inasmuch as it might internationalize the war in a way
offensive to the British, leaving the French with the difficult
choice of internationalization or capitulation. Dulles “eyes only”
tel. to Paris NIACT 4023, May 11, 1954. (TOP SECRET). The conditions
are also cited in Jean Lacouture and Philippe Devillers, La fin
d'une guerre: Indochine 1954 (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1960),

pp. 176-77.

Dulles' words are as paraphrased. In a State Department Memorandum
of Conversation, May 11, 1954, of a White House conference May 10

attended. by the President, Dulles, Wilson, Deputy Defense Secretary
Anderson, Radford, Robert Bowie, and Douglas MacArthur IT (TOP SECRET).

Dillon "eyes only" from Paris to the Under Secretary (for Dulles)
No. 4383, May 14, 1954 (TOP SECRET).

Dillon commented: "I am certain_that unless we can find some way
to get around this requirement [that the Vietnamese have the option
of leaving the French Union/, French will never ask for outside
assistance." In ibid.

Dillon proposed that the real objection among Asians to the

position of the Associated States rested. not on the "purely juridical”
problem of the right to leave the Union, but on Indochina's lack of
powerful national armies. The Ambassador recommended that American
training and equipping of the Vietnamese National Army (VNA), coupled
with a French statement of intention to withdraw the Expeditionary
Corps after the establishment of peace and a national army, would
significantly dampen Asian antagonism to the Bao Dai regime. (Dillon
from Paris tel. NIACT 402 to Dulles, May 17, 1954, TOP SECRET).
Why Dillon assumed Asians would significantly change their attitude
toward French Indochina when, even with an American takeover of the
training and equipping of the NVA, French forces would still be on
Vietnamese territory for a lengthy period is not known.
