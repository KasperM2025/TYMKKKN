Dear General Burns:

Embodied below is a brief statement of Department of State
policy in Indochina and Southeast Asia. I believe that an examin-
ation of this statement will:'facilitate your consideration of
wsc 64,

The Department of State continues to hold that Southeast
Asia is in grave danger of Communist domination as 4 consequence
of aggression from Communist China and of internal subversive —
activities. The Department of State maintains that Indochina,
subject as it is to the most immediate danger, is the most
strategically important area of Southeast Asia,

The Department of State believes that within the limitations
imposed by existing commitments and strategic priorities, the
resources of the United States should be deployed to reserve Indo-
china and Southeast Asla from further Communist encroachment,

The Department of State has accordingly already engaged all its
political rosources to the end that this object be secured, The :

Department is now engaged in-‘the process of urgently examining what

additional economic resources can effectively be engaged in the
same operation.

It is now, in the opinion of the Department,.a matter of the
greatest urgency that the Department of Defense assess the strategic
aspects of the situation and consider, from the military point of

view, how the United States can best contribute to the Peeve nts oe of

further Communist encroachment in that area,

The military assessment requested above is necessary to a
final determination by this Government of the manner in which
United States policy in this area shall be executed,

sincerely yours,

/s/ Dean Rusk
Deputy Under Secretary
