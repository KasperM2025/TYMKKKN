Reference to Indo-China, President said of course we
were intent upon doing nothing which in any way might in-
crease France's difficulties there, Instead we wanted to
help. As matter of fact, statement was now being prepared
within US Government concerning Far East, and Indo-China and --
Korea would be linked therein. President added that US repre-
sentatives had been somewhat disappointed in plan which had
been outlined by Mr. Letourneau at Pentagon on March 27 a.m.,
particularly by slowness of its time-table. He wanted to make
clear,however, that while there was no US commitment to support
this plan likewise there had been no US yaftisal to do so. Plan
required more careful study and President noted that this should
be possible as Mr, Letourneau was planning to stay until March 31

Re Indo-China plan, Mayer said concerning slowness of its tiack
timetable that while raising forces takes time it might perhaps
be possible to accelerate this even if human factors involved
might lead to somewhat lower quality of forces. However perhaps
more difficult is fact that there exists as yet no agreement
concerning military requirements, Mayer suggested that elabora-
tion of this plan could be completed in Saigon with participation
of US officers which Pentagon might care to send there for this
purpose atid that this aspect of problem could thus be covered
by further discussions between military technicians,

President said that US technicians will be glad to ccoperate
with French along above lines,
