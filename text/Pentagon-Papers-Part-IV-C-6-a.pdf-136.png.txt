able in the U.S. or to induce the enemy to believe that the U.S. is pre-
pared to stay as long as is required to produce a secure non-conmunist
SVN. Obviously a greatly improved pacification campaign must be waged to
take advantage of the protection offered by the major friendly forces.
Alternatively, if enemy strength is greatly overstated and our "seek out
and destroy" operations have been more effective than our strength and
joss estimates would imply - a possibility discussed below - more than
470,000 U.S. personnel should not be required to neutralize the VC/NVA
main force,

Attriting Enemy Forces. All of our estimates of enemy strength and
variations in it contain very great uncertainties. Thus, any conclusions
drawn from them must be considered to be highly tentative and conjectural.
Nevertheless, the data suggest that we have no prospects of attriting the

enemy force at a rate equal to or greater than his capability to infiltrate
and recruit, and this will be true at either the 476,C00 U.S. personnel
level or 570,000. The tabie on the followings vege shows our estimeies of
the average eneny loss rate per moath since April 1965. By 4th quarter 1965,
estimated militery losses (killed, captured, military derectors) reached
Ã©215 per week. The weekly average for CYO6 has remained about the same,
although enemy losses increased to 2330 per week in the 3rd quarter and to

2930 in October.

Enemy losses from wounds are included above based on the U.S. Intelli-
gence board estimate that there are 1.5 enemy wounded for each one killed,
with one-third of the wounded put out of action, resulting in a loss of .5
for each vc/NVA recorded killed, or 520 additional average losses per weak.

(MACV estimates .28 additional. losses for each VC/INVA killed, or an average
loss of 300 per week.) Also included are defectors not turning themselves
into the GYil centers, based on the Board estimate that there is one unre-
corded military deserter for each military defectcr, resulting in another
235 average losses per week.

The enemy loss rate was apparently not affected significantly by the
greatly increased friendly activity during 1966, which included: 44% in-
crease in battalion days of operation; 25% increase in battalion sized
