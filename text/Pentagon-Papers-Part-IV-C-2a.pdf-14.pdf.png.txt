DESCRIPTION

Authorized CIA-sponsored covert
operations against NVN.

JCS approved this program for
non-attributable "hit and run"
GVN covert operations against
NVN, supported by U.S. military
advisory materiel and training
assistance.

Military junta led by General Minh
assumed control.

During high-level USG discussions
of the probable consequences,
political and military, of Diem's
downfall, conferees agreed mili-
tary operations against the Viet
Cong had not been and would not
be particularly upset by the
changed political situation.
Development of a combined MACV-
CAS program for covert operations
against NVN was directed.

Authorized planning for specific
covert operations, graduated in
intensity, against the DRY.

State (and ISA) opposed overt
military operations in Laos.
Extension of CIA-sponsored covert
activity in Laos was okayed; this
neither threatened Souvanna's
sovereignty nor openly violated
the Geneva Accords which State
termed basic to eventual political
stability in the region.
