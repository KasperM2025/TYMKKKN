of U.S. declaratory policy would require making it public before applying
it. The need to be assured of "Congressional and other public support

in carrying through the thesis in a given case" would require this.
Therefore, the analysts concluded, "It would be exceedingly unwise to

pressures; and (5) the relationship perceived between increased pressures
and negotiatiors.

JOS views. Senior military officials differed among themselves
