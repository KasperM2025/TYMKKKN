At this point there was a brief discussion concerning the use
of U.S. troops for pacification purposes. Mr. Nitze indicated that in
his view the Marines were doing this to some degree. The point was
disputed. At any rate, Mr, McNamara said that the 102 combat
: battalions contemplated under Case 1 were not to be used for pacifica-
tion but only for defense of base areas and offensive operations,

Mr. McNamara outlined briefly the South Vietnamese Government's
plan for pacification, It will affect some 235,000 people in the whole
country, The major allocation of resources and personnel will be to
four very limited areas, one of which is near Danang. There will
also be a general program extending throughout the country involving
some 900 hamlets.

portant that everyone understand why a Reserve call-up is receiving
such careful study, There are at least two important considerations,
First, the problem is a very complicated ene and we do not yet have
all the facts, Mr. Morris and others will amass the necessary data
(ee as soon as possible, Second, the political aspects of a Reserve call-
up are extremely delicate, There are several strong bodies of opinion
at work in the country. Took, for example, at the Fulbright Conirnittee
hearings, One school of thought, which underlies the Gavin thesis, is
that this country is over-extended economically and that we cannot

we plain should not be there at all, whether or not we can afford it.
A third school of thought is that although we are rightly there, the war
is being mismanaged so that we are heading straight toward war with
China, Furthermore, there is no question but that the economy of
this country is beginning to run near or at its capacity with the result-
ing probability of a shortage of certain skills and materiel, If this
continues we may be facing wage and price controls, excess profits
taxes, etc., all of which will add fuel to the fire of those who say we
ia cannot afford this. With all these conflicting pressures it is a very
difficult and delicate task for the Administration to mobilize and main-
tain the required support in this country to carry on the war properly,
The point of all this is to emphasize that a call-up of the Reserves
presents extremely serious problems in many arcas and a decision
