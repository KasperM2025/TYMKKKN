The record does not show whether this memorandum was ever submitted
to or discussed with the President. In any event, the President had .
already made his decision by the time the above memorandum reached the
addressees. McCone, however, persisted in his concern over what he
felt was an inad2quately forceful air strike program and he did subse-
quently make his views known to the President, by way of a personal
memorandum and a coordinated intelligence estimate he handed to the
President on April 28, the date on which his successor, Admiral Raborn,
wes. sworn in. The memorandum itself is not available to this writer,
but both the estimate and Admiral Reborn's reaction to the two documents
are at hand. They are discussed in Section XIII below.
