eastern edge of the mountainous area. By the end of the year, the
attention of the Marines in the I Corps Tactical Zone was fastened
on the DMZ. 78/

In II CTZ, PAUL REVERE IV, which ran from 18 October through the
end of the year, conducted by elements of the recently arrived lth
Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division with later reinforce-
ment by two battalions of the 1st Cavalry Division, resulted in almost
@ thousand enemy killed. 79/

in III CTZ, in spite of the casualties which the enemy had sus-
tained in El PASO II, the 9th VC Division moved into well-concealed
base areas where he absorbed replacements, retrained them on their
equipment. In early November, the 9th VC Division moved into a new
base area near the Michelin Plantation intending to use this base as
a jumping off place for objectives in Tay Ninh. Instead, the enemy
collided with the 196th Infantry Brigade, resulting in Operation
ATTLEBORO. ATTLEBORO, begun on 14 September as a single battalion
search and destroy operation, expanded as additional base areas were
located and by 3 November, the operation had grown to include portions
of the lst Infantry Division, the 3rd Brigade of the th Infantry
Division and 173rd Airborne Brigade. By the time ATTLEBORO was termin-
ated in late November, the enemy had lost over 1,000 killed. The
pattern in III Corps, with the exception of a couple of operations in
Phuoc Tuy Province designed basically to clear the lines of communica-
tion from Saigon to Vung Tau, was a gradual shifting of emphasis north-
ward from Long An Provinee to Hoa Ninh Province to Binh Duong and then
north and west into Tay Ninh Province and War Zone C. 80/

By the end of the year, MACV estimated the total forces available
to the enemy in Vietnam at 152 combat battalions, the total personnel
strength of 280,600, of which 123,600 were combat or support troops,
112,000 were militia, and 39,000 were political cadre. MACV had accepted
a figure of 48,400 infiltrators during the year. An additional 25,600
may have infiltrated on the basis of information evaluated as possibly
true. This total of 74,000, accepted and possible, was based on infor-
mation available to MACV as of 31 Dec 66. The infiltration rate for
the first 6 months of 1966 was approximately 15 battalion equivalents.
Although most of this infiltration took place through Laos, an increasing
number had begun to infiltrate through the Demilitarized Zone as the
year wore on. 81/

Program 4 was promulgated on 18 November 1966. 82/ At the time it
was published events in Vietnam and decisions in Washington had essen-
tially rendered the ground strategy concepts of AB 142 meaningless.
Program 4 denied COMUSMACV the additional troops he proclaimed necessary
for the tasks set forth in AB 142, while the troops he did have were
engaged in War Zone C, in the highland border areas, and along the DMZ
-- far from the populated regions of Vietnam, which constituted the
National Priority areas of AB 12.
