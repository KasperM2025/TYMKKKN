On the most Bt aia oasis, 200,000 more PECn Cane would
raise their weekly losses % about 3,700, or about 400 a week more
than they could stand. In theory, we'd then wipe them out in 10 years.
“But to bank on that, you have to assume that (1) enemy losses are just
proportional to friendly strength, and (2) ‘that the unusually favoreble
kill ratio of the first quarter of 1967 will continue. However, if
the kill ratio should be no better than the 1966 average, their losses
would be about 2,100 -~ less then 2/3 of their sustaining capability.
But even that Pigure is misleading. Losses just aren't
directly related to the size of our force. Between the first ens
fourth quarters of 1966, our forces increased 23%, but their losses
increasedonly 13% -- little more than half as much.

Finally, the most important factor of all is that the enemy
ean control his losses within wide limits. The VC/NVA started the
shooting in over 90% of the company-sized fire fights; over 80% began

with a well-organized enemy attack. Since their losses rise (as in the
first quarter of 1967) and fall (as they have done since) with their’
choice of whether or not to Tight, they can probably hold their losses to
about 2, 000 a week researdiess of our FOR levels. If, as I believe,
their strategy is to wait us out, they will control their Losses to 4

level Jow enough to be sustained indefinitely, but high enough to tempt-

us to increase cur forces to the point cf U.S. public rejection of the

In swemary, I feel that adding more U.S, combat forces would be a

step in the wrong direction, They are now needed for military security,
