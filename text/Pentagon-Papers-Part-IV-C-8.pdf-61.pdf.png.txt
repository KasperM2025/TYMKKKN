Mr. Poats raised the question: What is the primary mission of the Division
Commander? Is it pacification? General Thang answered in the affirmative."

The discussion continued along these lines, and the airgram candidly
concludes: "Generals Co and Thang were being pressed by rather pointed
questions at this juncture and seemed to be trying to indicate that
pacification is a primary task, although other military tasks must continue
to be performed. It was fairly apparent that troops charged with securing
the pacification area are liable still to be withdrawn on a temporary basis
+o meet situations which ARVN senior commanders judge to be critical.”

The meeting then discussed the cadre progrem; the renewed emphasis on
village goverment; the role of the province chief (at this point General
Co made his statement that the GVN would appoint province chiefs for one
year minimum period, a decision which was never carried out); the intro-
duction of troops; the cadre (again); the six areas where the effort needed
improvement (agriculture, handicraft, land reform, rural electrification,
construction materials, and training of local officials); land reform
(with Minister Tri presenting his four-month old plan again, and Poats
expressing "concern about the performance to date”); and the general ques-
tion of pacification goals.

fnd then, after reporting back to the President in the meeting de-
seribed earlier, the participants broke up, returning to Saigon and
Washington to give "the other war" a new emphasis; to reorganize the Mis-
sion in Saigon; to appoint a new Special Assistant to the President in
Washington; to start the quest for coonskins (the phrase was in common use
in Saigon within a few days); to await the public and press reaction (see
following section); and to walk without warning into a major political
crisis which almost brought the government down, set back every time-
schedule made at Honolulu, forced a postponement of the next scheduled
conference from June-July until October, and -- through an ironic twist
of fate -- left the GVN stronger than before, following a remarkably
successful election.
