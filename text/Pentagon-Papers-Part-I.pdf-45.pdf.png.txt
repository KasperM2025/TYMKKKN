French emissaries approached Bao Dai with terms not unlike those
Ho Chi Minh had negotiated on 6 March 1946: unity and independence
within the French Union, provided Bao Dai formed a government which
would furnish a clear alternative to Ho Chi Minh's DRV. With French
encouragement, a group of Vietnamese Nationalists formed a political
party advocating the installation of Bao Dai at the head of a non-
Viet Minh Vietnamese regime. Bao Dai was at first evasive and skep-
tical, but was eventually convinced that the French situation in
Indochina was sufficiently desperate that they would have to honor
commitments they made to him. Bao Dai also seems to have believed
that he could attract American support and material aid -~ a view
which may have stemmed in part from a 1947 Life magazine article by
William C. Bullitt, the influential former U.S. Ambassador to France,
endorsing Bao Dai as a solution to France's dilemma. 56/

France then proceeded to contract with Bao Dai a series of agree-
ments, each of which ostensibly brought Bao Dai closer to genuine
autonomy for Vietnam. It was not, however, until February, 1950, that
the French National Assembly acceded to political independence and
unification for Vietnam. Chronicled below are the principal steps by
which France failed on the one hand to reach an accommodation ston
Ho Chi Minh, and on the other hand erected the â€œBao Dai solution" in
its stead. 57/
