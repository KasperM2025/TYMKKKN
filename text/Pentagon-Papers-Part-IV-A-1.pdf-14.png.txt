From 1949 through 1953 the National Security Council maintained the view
that a broader regional defense pact or association should be initiated

by the countries of the area. 15/ In the following 1950 exchange with

Congressman Fulton, Secretary of State Acheson expressed Administration

policy:

"MR. â€˜FULTON: May I read to the Secretary from the second.
paragraph of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act:

"The Congress hereby expresses itself as favoring the crea-
tion by the free countries and free peoples of the Far East, of
a joint organization consistent with the Charter of the United
Nations to establish a program of self-help and mutual coopera-
tion designed to develop their economic and social well-being,
to safeguard the basic rigs and liberties, and to protect their
security and independence. '

"Now may I point out that is a bipartisan policy, because
it was two Republicans and two Democrats on this committee who

the free peoples of the Far East and not created by the United
States. We are not calling these nations together and you never
asked us to call these nations together and tell them they should
create something. I know that your knowledge of the Far East
is sufficient to lead you to conclude that if we did that it would
have exactly the opposite effect of the one which you wish to
achieve. The President of the Philippines has been going forward
to accomplish this. We have stated to him, and publicly, that
we are most sympathetic to this activity on his part, but it
is most important that it should be a spontaneous Asian action." 16/

g- Indochina and United Action, 1954

"In the spring of 1954, however, the deterioration of the
French situation in Indochina caused a re-evaluation of U.S, policy on
collective security in Asia and precipitated proposals by the U.S. to
the French, the British and several other countries to establish some
