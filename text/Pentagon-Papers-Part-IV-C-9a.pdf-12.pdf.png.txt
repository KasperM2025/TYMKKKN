several weeks before any further announcement. Starting in May, he began
announcing specifics and signing decrees, and kept the idea live for
several months. However, strength of the RVNAF rose less in 1964 than it
@id in 1963”, and the talk of non-military mobilization came to nothing.

The military and the more militant civilians, on whom the U.S, counted
most heavily and regularly supported, turned out to have far more enthusiasm
for going North and for other external adventures than they did for getting
on ‘with the job of effective government and pacification. They promised

much on this latter score, but could not or would not deliver. Knowing

that we had no one else to turn to, they continued their old habits and
often openly did what they pleased about important matters. The go-North
problem was particularly troublesome because the militants rejected the
permanent division of Vietnam at the 17th parallel, upheld in practice by
the U.S,

The following are interesting instances, among many, of their super-
ficial compliance. They agreed readily to use U.S, advisers at the minis~
terial level (the brain trust), although there is no Sign that the brain-
trusters accomplished anything. Indeed, on all ten suggestions that
accompanied President Johnson's 1964 New Year's Message to Minh, only the
one on amnesty found them hesitant to express their full agreement. They
regularly agreed on budgetary limits to keep inflation from getting out of
hand, but never satisfied us on specifics through 196). or the first half of
1965. They repeatedly agreed to relieve ineffective, corrupt commanders
and officials, but delayed endlessly on doing it and generally promoted
those whom they relieved. At Westmoreland's request, Khanh created the
Hop Tac plan for pacification around Saigon; but it foundered, and eventually
the Vietnamese killed it. When Lodge left Vietnam in June, 1964, he sealed
his tour with a general agreement with Khanh on concept, scope, and organiza-
tion of the pacification efforts; obtaining such agreements presented abso-
dJutely no problem. In December, 196/:, the JGS issued a directive containing
every MACV suggestion on how RVNAF should help pacification.
