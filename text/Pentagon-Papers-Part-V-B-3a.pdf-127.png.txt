FOR RELEASE AT 7:00 A.IM.5;E.D.T.,SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1953....

In response to an invitation from the French
Prime Minister, when he visited Washington last
March, a United States Military Mission headed by
Lt. General John W. O'Daniel presently commander
United States Army Pacific will arrive Saigon
June 20. Its purpose will be to pursue discussions
with General Henri Navarre, Commander in Chief
Indochina, on the manner in which United States
material and financial support of the effort of the
French and Associated States armed forces in
Indochina may bést contribute to the advancement
of theoobjective of defeating the Communist forces
there and of bringing peace and security to Viet-
Nam, Cambodia and Laos. It is believed essential
to insure an increasingly close integration of
United States assistance with the plans developed
by the authorities of France and of the Associated
States.

Arrangements are being made for the military
leaders of the Associated States to participate
in these discussions. The vital role of the national
armies of Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos and the in-
creasingly important assumption of ‘high military
responsibilities by the Associated States will make
these discussions of particular interest.
