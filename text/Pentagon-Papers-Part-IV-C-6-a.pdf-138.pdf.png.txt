operations contacting the enemy; and 284 increase in small unit actions
accompanied by a 124 increase in contacts. Moreover, armed helicopter
sorties doubled from 14,000 to 29,000 per month and attack sorties in SVN
rose from 12,800 to 14,000 per month.

The failure of enemy losses to increase during the first half of 1966
was primarily due to the January Vietnamese New Year lull, the political
turmoil during the Spring, the apparent decrease in ARVN efficiency, and an
increasing enemy reluctance to fight large battles.

Despite improvements during the past four months, it.is impossible
to predict the point st which we can expect to attrite enemy forces at the
rete he introduces new ones. As the table above indicates, an average enemy
total loss rate of 2230 per week has prevailed for the past 13 months, com-
pared to the calculated enemy personnel input rate of 2915 per week for the
same period. The input rate is that required to provide the average increase
of 685 per week reflected in the vc/NVA order of battle strength figures
estimated by MACV, it is not estimated independently. Assuming that the
weekly infiltration rate from NVN for the past 13 months averaged 1075 as -
estimated (MACV indicates that the 1966 figure my be as high as 1638 per
week), VC recruitment (input minus infiltration) must have been about 1840
per week. This recruitment rate lies well within the current U.S. Intelli-
gence Board estimate that the VC can recruit and train 1635 to 2335 men
per week, and can replace current losses solely from within South Vietnam
if necessary. But it lies far above the current MACV recruitment estimate
of 815 VC personnel per week.
