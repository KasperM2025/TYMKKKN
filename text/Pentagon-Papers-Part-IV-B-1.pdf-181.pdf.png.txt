WAY. THAT IS BECAUSE HE CANNOT. IT 1S POLITICALLY NAIVE TO EXPECT IT. —
HE SENSES THAT HE CANNOT LET POWER GO BECAUSE HE WOULD BE THROWN OUT. <i
HE MAY DISGUISE THIS EVEN FROM HIMSELF WITH THE STATEMENT THAT HE LACKS
EFFECTIVE SUSORDINATES BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED. HE
PROBABLY SENSES THAT HIS GREATEST DANGER 1S FROM THE ARMY. - HENCE THE
REFORM THAT WILL BRING EFFECTIVE USE OF HIS MANPOWER, THOUGH THE MOST
URGENT MAY BE THE MOST IMPROBABLE. — !
THE POLITICAL REFORMS ARE EVEN MORE UNLIKELY BUT THE ISSUE
IS ACADEMIC. ONCE THE IMAGE OF A POLITICIAN IS FIXED, WHETHER AMONG
OPPOSITION INTELLECTUALS OR PEASANTS, IT 1S NOT CHANGED. NOR DO
POLITICIANS CHANGE THEMSELVES. DIEM?S IMAGE WOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY

HIS TAKING FN OTHER NON-COMMUNISTS, INITEFATING SOME SOCIAL REFORMS OR

It is a cliche that there is no alternative to Diem's regime.
This is politically naive. Where one man has dominsted the
scene for good or ill there never seems to be. No one considered
Truman an alternative to Roosevelt. There is none for Nehru.
There was none I imagine for Rhee. This is an optical illusion
arising from the fact that the eye is fixed on the visible
figures. It is a better rule that nothing succeeds like success-
ors.

We should not be alarmed by the Army as an alternative. It

would buy time and get a fresh dynamic. It is not ideal; civilian
rule is ordinarily more durable and more saleable to the world.
