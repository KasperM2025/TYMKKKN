DESCRIPETON

lodge approves the proposed course

of action but sees no reason to approach
Diem first. Diem will not remove the
Nhus and it would merely tip off the
palace to the impending military action.

Lodge, Harkins, and Richardson meet
and agree on an approach to the generals
with the information in State's 23.

Early on this Monday morning, VOA in
South Vietnam broadcasts the press
stories placing blame for the Aug 21
raids on Nhu and absolving the Army.
It also broadcast press speculation
that the U.S. is contemplating an
aid suspension.

Later the same morning, Lodge presents
his credentials to Diem, after an early
morning meeting with Harkins and
Richardson, at which they agree on

the details of the approach to the gen-

erals.

The Aug 24 cable of instructions had
been drafted, cleared and sent on a
weekend with McNamara, McCone, Rusk
and the President all out of town.
The NSC meeting on Monday morning
reveals that these top advisors have
reservations about proceeding hastily
with a coup when we Jack so much basic
information about its leadership and
chances. Lodge is asked for more
details.

CAS agents Conein and Spera meet with
Generals Khiem and Khanh respectively.
Khiem tells Conein that other partici-
pants are Generals Minh, Kim, Thieu
and Le, and thet General Don was aware
of the plot and approved, but was too
exposed to participate.

Lodge gives an optimistic appraisal

of the balance of forces for a coup
and expresses confidence in the identi-
fied leaders.
