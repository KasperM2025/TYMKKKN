The basic strategy which must be followed by MACV in any
circumstances is to defeat the current enemy offensive both
in Northern I Corps Tactical Zone where it is the most formidable,
in the Highlands where it is highly dangerous, and throughout
South Vietnam in defense of the government and the cities and
towns..--Allied forces are not conducting offensive operations
of any great magnitude or frequency and therefore they are not
wresting control of the countryside from the enemy....

If the enemy offensive can be broken with sustained heavy
casualties, then, and only then, will the cities be secure and
the countryside reentered. Even with the largest force
contemplated (Option 1) it will not be possible to perform
adequately all of the tasks unless the current enemy offensive
is decisively defeated. This, therefore, is the first and most
important task upon which all else depends....

If the forces now in Vietnam or the forces under any of the
options prove to be inadequate to break the enemy offensive, or if,
conversely, the enemy sustained offensive breaks the Vietnamese
armed forces (even short of destroying the GVN), then our objectives
in South Vietnam and the tasks associated with them will be un-
obtainable. Specifically, we would be unable to regain the
initiative, that is, we would not be able to conduct offensive
operations at the scope and pace required either to prevent further
enemy buildup or to reenter the countryside. This would force US
and allied forces into a defensive posture around the major
population centers....

Therefore, immediate action to break the enemy's current
offensive is not only the first but the decisive requirement.

In specifically addressing each of the options, the Joint Staff reach-
ed the following conclusions;
