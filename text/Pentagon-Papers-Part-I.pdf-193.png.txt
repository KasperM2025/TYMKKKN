It is vital to remember that, unlike any other successful communist
movement, the Vietnamese party fought its way to ruling power in virtual
isolation. In Eastern Europe, Soviet troops were always present in the
countries where communist takeovers took place; in fact, they were an es-
sential ingredient. In China, the turnover to the communists of vast stores
of Japanese arms by the Soviet Forces in Manchuria was of vital importance
to the CCPs military success, and the Russian military presence in North
Korea ensured the creation of a "people's democracy" there. In Albania,
Tito's partisans played the role of Soviet troops elsewhere. In the Viet-
Nam of 1945, on the contrary, the D.R.V.N. had no such support from either
the Soviets or even the Chinese Communists (then bottled-up in the hills
of northwestern China); and. connections with the French CP, then just
emerging from four years of clandestinity, were probably nonexistent for
the simple reason that the first postwar ships to go from France to Indo-
china only reached Saigon in late September 1945 -- and these were troop
transports bringing the vanguard of the French Expeditionary Force. In
other words, the Vietnamese Communists literally had to play their revo-
lution alone and by ear.
