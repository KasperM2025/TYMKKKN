required. 85/ From 1956 through 1960 Ho, at some cost, honored the
principle Mao intoned at the Communist summit meeting in Moscow in
November, 1957: the Communist bloc must have a head and the Soviet

Union must be that head. 86/ Soviet rebuffs of the DRV must have there-
fore been particularly painful for Ho. In the 9th Plenum of the Lao Dong
Party Central Committee (19-2 April 1956) Ho--who was in person the DRV's
prime political asset, especially in view of Diem's ascendancy--dutifully
recited the de-Stalinizing cant of the 20th Congress of the CPSU extrolling
collective leadership, and damning the evil cult of the individual. 87/
Two weeks later, as the outcome of the meeting of Co-Chairmen of the Geneva
Conference at which the Soviets tacitly accepted status quo in Vietnam,

Ho received a message, dated 8 May 1956, signed by A. Gromyko, First Deputy
Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, acting with the authority of his
government, addressed to two sovereign states: the Governments of the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam. 88/ Inmedi-
ately after the deadline for elections passed, in August 1956, Ho penned

a Pravda article deprecating notions that the DRV reunification "struggle"
was a Vietnamese affair, denying that the DRV might develop a “national
communism" of the Tito model, and rejecting ideas that the DRV might use-
fully pursue a course independent of the Bloc. 89/ The following January,
1957, after a stormy autumn of insurrection, the Rectification of Errors
Campaign, and "Hundred Flowers," Ho was surprised by the Soviet proposal
at the United Nations to formalize Vietnamese disunity by admitting both
the DRV and the GVN as member states. 90/ Nor were these the only
instances of tepid support or countervailing policy from the Soviets.

The DRV forwarded messages to the GVN in July 1955, May and June 1956,
July 1957, March 1958, July 1959, and July 1960, urging a consultative
conference on elections, offering to negotiate on the basis of “Pree
general elections by secret ballot," and urging liberalization of North-
South relations. Throughout, the Soviet Union never went beyond words

and gestures of solidarity.

For Ho Chi Minh, the major international difficulties
in securing foreign aid had internal ramifications as well. There is
evidence of a rising tide of conviction within the Lao Dong Party that
more forceful measures were necessary towards reunification, which took
the form in 1957 of an attack upon Ho Chi Minh's own position, and upon
the Soviet-oriented faction within the Party elite. 91/ There was also
an evident realignment of the DRV hierarchy in which Le Duan, an advocate
of forceful resolution of the impasse with Diem, came to prominence in
mid-1957. 92/ (Le Duan who served in the South, through 1956, appears
to have been de facto the Secretary General of the Party 1957-1960; there-
after, he openly held the office, and is considered the second ranking
member of the Politburo.) 93/

Ho Chi Minh, despite rumors that he was dead or discarded,
survived the 1957 crisis seemingly intact.

By 1958 the DRV elite were apparently more disposed to

seek their own solutions in Vietnam, less sensitive to the persistent
coolness of Khruschev, and more responsive to Mao than theretofore. After
