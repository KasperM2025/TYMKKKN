DESCRIPTION

Nolting returns to Vietnam with
Washington's blessing to make one last
attempt to persuade Diem to conciliate
the Buddhists. The hope is to draw

on the good will that Nolting has
built up in his two years of service.

At a special meeting for all senior
generals, Nhu attacks their loyalty
to the regime for not having thwarted
the numerous coup plots that had been
reported. The meeting apparently
forestalls any immediate threat to
the family.

Deeply resentful of Truehart's tough
pressure tactics, Nolting meets with
Diem and attempts to mollify him. .
He convinces Diem to make a nation-
wide radio address with concessions
to the Buddhists.

Complying with the letter but not the
spirit of Nolting's request, Diem
delivers a brief cold ratio address
that makes only very minor concessions
to the Buddhists and asks for harmony
and support of the Government.

At a press conference, Secretary
McNamara says the war is progressing
well and the Buddhist crisis has not
yet affected it.

A second Buddhist monk commits suicide
by burning himself to death in the
continuing protest against the Diem
regime.

In their final meeting before Nolting's
departure from Vietnam, Diem promises
to make a public statement repudiating
Mme Nhu's inflammatory denunciations of
the Buddhists. WNolting left the next
day.

Diem's promised public statement takes

the form of an interview with Marguerite
Higgins, conservative correspondent
