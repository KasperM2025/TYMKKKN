Dept has predicated its course of action in Indochina since FEB 2Â°
this year on assumption that fundamental objectives of US and France
in Indochina are in substantial coincidence, Dept assunes:

1, That Fronch are determined to protect IC fron further COMME
encroachnents by POLIT, ECON as woll as MIL measures,

2, That French understand that success of MIL Seaton. ee
containnont of northern border against COMAE penetration as well a
reduction of Ho's forces elsewhere IC, depends, in the end on overconing
opposition of indigenous population,

3, Therefore France proposes in supvort of this policy to strengthen
Bao Dai and the Kings of Laos and Carbodia in covery practical way, to end
that non-COMU@S nationalists abandon Ho, support Bao Dai and Kings and
can thus reduce guerrilla activity.

It is ovident from reaction fsian states to US and FR effort to
secure their recognition Bao Dai, from attitude Scandinavian powers and
fron reactions US press that large segnent public opinion both East and
West continues to regard Bao Dai and two Kings as French puppets not
enjoying nor likely to enjoy degree of autonory within FR Union eeccorded
then under MLR 8 agreements, analogous to that accorded INDO by NETH,

US Govt has used its POLIT resources and is now engage
to accelerate its ECON and financial assistance to IG states, As you

aspects of the situation and cons ider, from the nil point of view, how
