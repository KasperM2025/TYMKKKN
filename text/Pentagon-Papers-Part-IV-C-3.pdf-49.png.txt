In the meantime, a 7 January 1965 conference of SEACORD (the

coordinating mechanism of the U.S. ambassadors and military commanders

in Southeast Asia) had reviewed the accomplishments of the first few
weeks of Phase I--the 30-day program of mild BARREL ROLL, YANKEE TEAM
and other operations--and had concluded that the results were militarily
negligible. SEACORD recommended an extension: of the operations for
another 30 days, and their intensification as "an effective tonic /for
the Gv, particularly if accompanied by serious joint preparations and
timely initiation of retaliatory and Phase II operations against the
DRV." 22/

The most forceful restatement of the reprisal policy, however,
came from the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the end of January, in the form
of a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense 23/ reviewing earlier JCS
recommendations on reprisals and noting that the continued lack of a U.S.
response to major enemy provocations risked inviting more such actions.
They urged that the next significant provocation be met with a "positive,
timely, and appropriate response...undertaken preferably within twenty-four
hours, against selected targets in the DRV." 2h/ They appended to their.
memorandum a resume of possible reprisal actions of varying intensities,
for which plans were available and the strike forces at hand to carry out
these actions. The most intensive preparations had already been made,
particularly in connection with the forthcoming resumption of the DESOTO
Patrols, to which a reprisal operation was explicitly linked as a contin-
â€™ gency option, under the code name FLAMING DART. These preparations and
the evolution of the readiness posture associated with this and other
potential. reprisal actions is reviewed briefly in the next section.
