Se I ASKED FOR A STAFF STUDY TO REDUCE THESE PIASIER REQUESTS TO
A LEVEL WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH REASONABLE ECONG4IC STABILITY
DURING 1967 AND YET WHICH DOES NOT JEOPARDIZE OUR MILITARY
PROGRESS AND OUR CIVILIAN PROGRAMS, THE STAFF RECOMMENDED

A LEVEL OF 33 BILLION PIASTERS FOR THE U.S. MILITARY FORCES.
MACV STATED THAT THIS WAS TOO LOW TO ALLOW FOR EXPANSION OF
FOXCES IN 1957 AND I AGREED. A SECOND STAFF STUDY WAS PREPARED
WHICH SET 39 BILLION AS A MAXIMUM FIGURE FOR THE U.S.

MILITARY FORCES. THIS TOO WAS TURNED DOWF BY GENERAL
WESTMORELACD AS BEING INADEQUATE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

MACV DURING 1967. AGAIN, I AGREE.

A. ON THE CIVILIAN SIDE THE FIRST STAFF STUDY RECOMMENDED

A LEEL OF 18 BILLION PIASTERS OF WHICH USAID WOULD RECEIVE

12 BILLION, THIS IS 3 BILLION LESS THAN USAID REQUESTED.

THE SECOND STAFF STUDY PROPOSED 16 SILLION PIASTERS OF WHICH
USAID WOULD RECEIVE 10 BILLICN. HIS REDUCTION WAS NOT

AGREED TO BY UR, MCDONALD OF USAID WHO SAID HE DID NOT

REGARD THIS REDUCED AMOUNT SUFFICIENT FINANCING FOR

ESSENTIAL GVN/US BUILD-UP ON THE CIVILIAN SIDE.

C. THE DANGER. ATION

De FAILING AGREEMENT AMONG oe. AGENCIES, J HAVE REVIEWED
BOTH THE VARIOUS PIASTER REQUESTS AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AFD
Ali HERE PRESENTING FOR WASHINGTON CONSDERATION MY PROPOSAL

FOR PIASTER SPENDING CEILINGS IN CALENDAR YEAR 1967. BEFORE
PGESENTING THIS PROPOXSAL, IT IS IMPORTANT TO GkT CLEARLY IN MIND
WHY AN INCREASE IN SPENDING BY JI.S, AGENCIES OF 33 BILLION
PIASTERS DURING 1967 JS INTOLERABLE AND MUST BE REDUCED
- LET US FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT CONSIDER THIS LHOLE SU3JECT

IN THE LIGHT OF .THE AMERICAN SOLDIER'S LIFE. CLEARLY, HIS LIFE
CAN BE IMPERILED SEVERAL WAYS:

A) THE MOST O3VIOUS IS BY DEFEAT IN BATTLE.

B) BUT IN THIS COUNTRY, A WILDCAT, SOUL DESTROYING INFLATION
WHICH MEANS THAT VIETNAMESE MILITARY PERSONNEL CANNOT MAKE
BOTH ENDS MEET AND THEREBY THE VIETNAMESE ARMED FORCES LOSE
FIGHTING QUALITY COULD ALSO JEOPARDIZE OUR OWF TROOPS.

C) ALSO, AN INFLATION WHICH RESULTS IN THOUSANDS GF ADULTS
DEMONSTRATING IN THE STREETS (WHERE FORMALLY WE HAVE HAD ONLY
ROCK~THROWING TEENAGERS) ,/ WITH THERESULTING POLITICAL
INSTABILITY LEADING TO THe OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNIENT, COULD
BE AN EVEN MORE PRESSING DANGER--MORE SO EVEN THAN DEFEAT IN
BATTLE, INDEED, RAND REPORTS INDICATE VIET CONG PRISONERS NO
LONGER BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN BE VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE, BUT ARE
COUNTING ON GVERTHROVING THE GOVERNMENT IN SAIGON, THIS IS THE
POLITICAL DANGER WHICH INFLATION CAN CAUSE.

6. THEREFORE, IF WE LOOK AT THIS PROPOSITION SOLELY FROM THE
STANDPOINT OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE SCLDIER, WE FIND OUR-
SELVES CAUGHT BETWEEN VARIOUS INEXORASLES: THE INEXORASLES

OF BATTLE, OF INFLATION, AND OF POLITICS

7. LET US NOW CONSIDER THESE VARIOUS, APPARENTLY CONFLICTING,
INEXORASLES, TAXING THE MILITARY FIRST.
