in Europe, (b) this was the only program that would convince the people
of the three Associated States of Indochina "of the honesty of French
intentions to give them full independence within the French Union,"

and (c) the French Government would welcome the replacement of French
troops by indigenous forces and would aid in every way possible short
of assuming an added financial burden which would directly impair its
ability to increase its forces in Western Europe. Premier Pleven
further stated that it was impossible for the French Government to
implement this program due to the lack of funds.

On 22 September, the French Ministers of Foreign Affairs and
Defense informed the Secretaries of State and Defense of "the need to
create immediately powerful national Indochinese armies due to neces-
sity of repatriating as many French forces as possible, since 20 per-
cent of French regular officers and 40 percent of French noncoms were
frozen in Indochina." Schuman and Moch stated that there were 72,000
men in local armies but â€œthe desired substantial increase in this
number would present budgetary problems which neither France nor the
Associated States could presently meet."

Although the French have stated their objective, they have not,
as yet, provided the U.S. Government with any firm figures on the
size or the costs of the proposed National Armies. The French High
Commissioner in Saigon has frequently used the figure of a regular

Vietnamese forces of 120,000 men to be organized by July 1951.
