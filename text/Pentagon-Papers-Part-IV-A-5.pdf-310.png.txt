"SENATOR MANSFIELD. Assuming no drastic change in the general
situation in Indochina, what do you see in the next h years as
to the requirements of military aid in Vietnam? Are they likely
to be substantially higher, are they likely to continue to be—
reduced in size or do you think they will remain just about the
same? This calls for an estimate and an informed guess.

"GENERAL WILLIAMS. I would like to caution that what I say now
will be a guess, based, however, on past experience and considered
judgment.

"T would say that for 1960 the military budget should be
practically the same as 1959. I should think beginning in 1961,
I hope not later than 1961, it should start to decrease again.

including deobligations and adjustments, 1954-1961.

3/ Total grants and loans, 1946-1961: 3587 -6

This program was among the largest in the world, reflecting a
U. S. commitment sufficiently deep to assert a high priority for Viet-
nam among the numerous claimants for U.S. aid. From FY 1946 through
FY 1961, Vietnam was the third ranking non-NATO recipient of aid,
and the seventh worldwide; in FY 1961, the last Eisenhower program,
South Vietnam was the fifth ranking recipient overall (behind India,
Korea, Brazil, and Turkey):
