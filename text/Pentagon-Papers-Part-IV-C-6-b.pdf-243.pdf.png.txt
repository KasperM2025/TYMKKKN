campaign casualty costs by saying that if for
every 123 attack sorties in Route Packages IV
through VI, or for every 557 sorties in Route
Packages I through III, or for every 881 attack
sorties in Laos we have reduced allied deaths in
the South by one, they are worth their human cost.

In terms of dollar costs, if every 1000
attack sorties per calendar year in out-of-
country operations reduce the requirements for
US ground troops by about 300, they pay their
way. If the proportionality of friendly force
increments to enemy force increments is a cor-
rect concept, this means that, to pay their way,
every 1000 out-of-country sorties per year must
account for 37 of the infiltrators who could have
come in but didn't.

deployments. (SecDef Control No. X-4239, 11 Jul 1967.)
