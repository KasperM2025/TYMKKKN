GVN-Buddhist communique

DESCRIPTION

The first meeting between the Tho
committee and the Buddhist leader-
ship takes place, after which
each side publicly questions the
other's good faith in the negotia-
tions.

Madame Nhu, wife of Diem's powerful
brother, publicly accuses the Buddhists
of being infiltrated with communist
agents.

Later on the same day, Truehart
protests Mme Nhu‘'s remakrs to Diem
and threatens to dissociate the U.S.
from any future repressive measures
against the Buddhists.

At noon in the middle of a downtown
intersection, a Buddhist monk, Thich
Quang Duc, is immersed in gasoline
and sets himself afire. His fiery
protest suicide is photographed and
is front page material in the world's
newspapers. Shock and indignation
are universal. Mme Nhu subsequently
refers to it as a "barbecue."

Truehart sees Diem again to protest
his lack of action on the Buddhist
problem and says that Quang Duc's
suicide has shocked the world. If
Diem does not act, the U.S. will be
forced to dissociate itself from
him.

Under U.S. pressure, negotiations
between Vice President Tho's committee
and the Buddhist leadership reopen

in apparent earnest.

A joint GVN-Buddhist communique is
released as a product of the nego-
tiations that outlines the elements
of a settlement, but affixes no re-
sponsibility for the May 8 Hue inci-
dent.
