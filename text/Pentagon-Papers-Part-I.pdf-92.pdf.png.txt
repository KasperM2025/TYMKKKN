"The peasant's painful efforts, wrote an exceedingly tame
Vietnamese nationalist during the 1920's, are not rewarded with
sufficient well-being, so he ‘dreams of more happiness, of more
justice.’ There can be no doubt that he did. But what the
moderate nationalists failed to see was that by 1930, a great
many peasants were ready to proceed from dream to action. They
would now have listened to any party whose leaders were ready
to make the troubles of the poor their chief political concern.
This, unfortunately, was grasped only by the communists. When
they proclaimed that the struggle for independence could have
meaning for the poor only if independence aimed at improving
their social condition, the communists had won the first round
in their fight for leadership of the nationalist camp." 2/

The reformist parties were strongest in Cochinchina. There the French
administered directly rather than through Vietnamese as in Annam or Tonkin,
and, apparently feeling more secure in their control, tolerated in the South
open Vietnamese political activism prohibited in central and north Vietnam.
Nonetheless, no reformist movements acquired a popular base, and a1] were
moribund at the start of World War II.
