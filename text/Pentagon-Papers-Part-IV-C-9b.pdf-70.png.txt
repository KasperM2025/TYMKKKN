establish $50 million development fund in return for their
purchase of 300 thousand tons of rice on a 100% US use basis
and repayment of $25 million ICA loan. 48/

From Komer, now back in Washington, came this reply,

There is in my view no doubt whatever thet Hanh, and for
that matter Ky, understood full well that we did not agree
to the $50 million GYN Development Fund as part of interim
packege. Nor do I regard our credibility as erhanced if we
now retreat even more on this issue. Finally, I regard the
Development Fund as a sweetener so clearly wanted by the
GVN that we need not give it away too cheaply.

While in one sense we have little immediate leverage to
use on the GVN so long as we do not choose to withhold
aid in one form or another, in another sense we clearly
heve the GVN worried. I believe that, either through 4
definitive solution this June or more likely via

Salami tactics, we can keep GVN reserves from rising too
far. 49/

In mid-March Komer reached another “Interim Agreement” with GVN on
foreign exchange. 50/ It provided that:

(1) The United States would supply at least an addi-
tional 100,000 tons of PL 480 rice and a further
300,000 tons of rice under terms providing for
100% USG use of proceeds.

(2) GVN would make available up to $120 million of
foreign exchange for financing commodities pre-
viously imported under the CIP.

(3) The United States would make available for economic
development projects the balance of FY 67 funds
unused as a result of the reduction of the CIP pro-
grem and would proceed to initiate and make grants
for several interim projects.

(4) The United States agreed to the establishment by GVN
of a $50 million development fund for purchase of US
goods and services, such fund to be considered as use
of Vietnemese foreign exchange resources under the
November 4, 1966 agreement.

(5) GV would repay US loans totalling $53 million. 51/
