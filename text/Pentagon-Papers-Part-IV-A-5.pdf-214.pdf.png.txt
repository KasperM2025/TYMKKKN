The 1951 Lao Dong document quoted above stipulated that:

"Not only is it our duty to aid the revolutionaries in
Cambodia and Laos, but we must also aid the revolutionary
movements in the other countries of Southeast Asia, countries
such as Malaya, Indonesia, Burma, etc." 101/

Since DRV independence in 1954, its foreign policy has openly supported
neutral regimes in Laos and Cambodia, while covertly it has undertaken
major politico-military operations in Laos, and supported subversive
organizations in Cambodia and Thailand. 102/ It is possible to infer,

as has P. J. Honey, that the ultimate DRV objective is Vietnamese hegemony
over Indochina: Quasi-independent, communist governments controlled by the
Hanoi leaders through the Lao Dong apparatus. However, it is also Chee
to interpret the Lao Dong Party tracts as bombast, and DRV extra-territoria
operations as a necessary part of its thrust toward reunification of Viet=
nam. Jt is clear that DRV control of the Laotian Panhandle and the Mu Gia
and Keo Nua Passes would be essential to any contemplated large scale infil-
tration of men and materiel from North to South Vietnam.

D. Links With the Viet Cong

From 1954 on, the DRV possessed four principal ties with insur-
gents within South Vietnam: the Southern Viet Minh who were regrouped
to the North; the "Fatherland Front," the DRV mass political organization
devoted in part to maintaining identification with Southerners, and pro-
moting the cause of reunification before the world; some commonality of
leaders; and the Lao Dong Party. Fach of these deserve discussion pre-
liminary to analyzing the extent to which these links permitted Hanoi
to influence the form and pace of the insurgency in South Vietnam.

i. Southerners in the North. The estimated 130,000 "regroupees"
of Geneva in North Vietnam after the evacuations of 1954-1955 included as
many as 90,000 "soldiers," and possibly half that number of dependents.
There were among then possibly 10,000 children, and about the same number
of Montagnards. Of this entire group, U.S. intelligence estimates indicate
that about 30-35,000 have since returned to South Vietnam. 103/ er uees
provided virtually all the infiltrators in the period 1959-196. Thereafter,
known infiltration has been almost exclusively by Northerners, which has
led U.S. intelligence to conclude that the DRV had by 1964 exhausted its
"pool" of trained and able manpower among the regroupees. 10)./ As of
July, 1967, the GVN had only a small fraction of the Southern regroupee
infiltrators under its control: 180 POW, and an undetermined (probably
very much smaller) number of defectors. 105/ In August, 1966, a DOD
contractor published a study based on detailed interrogation of 71 of these
regroupees (56 POW and 15 defectors) plus 9 other NLF members. 106/ â€˜two
out of three in the sample were Comnunist Party members; all regroupees had
undergone intensive training in the DRV before being sent south. The
earliest trip South by any among the group was 1960, the latest 1961. The
survey of their experiences and attitudes affords sone insights into the
policy and operations of the DRY.
