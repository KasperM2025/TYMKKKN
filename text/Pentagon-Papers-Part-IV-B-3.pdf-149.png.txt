In March, two days before the Guam Conference was to meet, General Westmore-
land sent an important cable to CINCPAC requesting an “optimum force" increase,
above and beyond the approved Deployment Program , of 4-2/3 U.S, divisions
(201,250 personnel spaces), or a "minimum essential force" of an additional
2-1/3 U.S. divisions’ (84,100 spaces). 207/ The optimum force would have
raised total U.S, manpower in Vietnam to over 670,000 troops. This request
was to kick off (after Guam, where it was not specifically addressed)
another prolonged internal administration debate and review of forces in
Vietnam which would eventually culminate in Secretary McNamara's July trip
to Saigon and the subsequent decision to adopt deployment Program 5, raising
total authorized strength to 525,000. COMUSMACV's orientation toward
RVNAF's role in the war is Clearly revealed in this message:

Whereas deployment of additional US forces in FY 68 will

obviate the requirement for a major expansion of the RVNAT,
selective increases will be necessary to optimize combat
effectiveness. Regular forces proposed for FY 68 total

328,322, an increase of 6,367 spaces over the FY 67 authorization.
As US, Pree World and RVNAP operations are expanded, additional ~
areas will be made available for the conduct of Revolutionary
Development operations. Based on experience gained thus far,

an increase of 50,000 Rir/PF spaces will be required to provide

a planning figure of 350,000 spaces for this force. ‘The
increase will accommodate necessary support of Revolutionary
Development and concomitantly, will be compatible with
requirements incident to implementation of the constabulary
concept. 208/
