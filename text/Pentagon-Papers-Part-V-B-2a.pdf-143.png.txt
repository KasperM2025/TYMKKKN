But should this resistance be broken in Tonkin during the coming
fall campaign, there is no doubt whatsoever that the final settlement
will in practice be even less liberal then its present form.

As it now stands, the French position as expressed by M. Bollaert
is an elastic instrument which will become a vise if the Vietnam Govern-
ment is crushed but which, if this task proves beyond French military
strength, can be stretched even to cover negotiations with Ho.

Respectfully yours,

James 1. O'Sullivan
