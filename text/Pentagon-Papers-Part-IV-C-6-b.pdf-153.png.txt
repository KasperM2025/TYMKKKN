Attachment 5, dated 4 May 1967. This attachment was prepared to
be included in the 19 May DPM. However, it was removed from the
paper and never forwarded along with the finished DPM.

Ibid.; See Memorandum for the President from W. W. Rostow, Subject:
"Vietnam Force Level Sharing," dated 10 May 1967. One of the prob-
lems which periodically reappeared and was discussed reference
asking for greatly increased contributions of allied troops was
what the command relationship should be in Vietnam. One of the
proposals consistently forwarded was that of developing a "NATO-
style" combined U.S. Republic of Vietnamese armed forces Free
World Military Armed Forces Command under General Westmoreland.

The judgment of all senior people in Saigon had been that the
possible military advantages of such action would be outweighed

by its adverse psychological impact; that it would cut across

the picture of the Vietnamese winning their own war, and lay the
United States open to hostile propaganda both within South Viet-
nam and around the world. This idea of a unified command although
surfacing periodically as we have noted was never given serious
consideration until much later when the United States at least
floated the idea in an attempt to develop entres to the eventual
disengagement. (Memorandum, Subject: Position on U.S. /Other Than
