The November, 1960, coup marked the end of opposition by
professional politicians against Diem. In fact, all the Caravelle group
were arrested and jailed. Such political activity among them as occurred
in 1962 and 1963 was perforce subdued to the point that it captured atten-

Catholic writer and commentator on Vietnam, Graham Greene, observed in 1955
that:

"Tt is Catholicism which has helped to ruin the government
of Mr. Diem, for his genuine piety has been exploited by his
American advisers until the Church is in danger of sharing the
unpopularity of the United States. An unfortunate visit by
