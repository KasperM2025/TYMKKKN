STATEMENT ON INDOCHINA BY THE
HONORABLE DEAN RUSK, ASSISTANT SECRETARY
OF STATE FOR FAR EASTERN AFFAIRS
November 27, 1950

The United States Gov√©rnment welcomes the defini-
tion of the policy of France in Indochina as described
in the statement of Monsieur Letourneau, the Minister
of Associated States, as confirmed by the Prime
Minister, Monsieur Pleven, and by the resolution of
the National Assembly which approved that policy.

It will be particularly reassuring to nations of

the free world to know that the independence of

the Associated States of Indochina within the
framework of the French Union is now assured and
that the military and economic resources of the
French Republic and of the Associated States of
Indochina will be directed with boldness and re-
newed resolution to the defense of Indochina against
communist colonialism.

To the end that the armies of the Associated
States of Indochina and the French Union accomplish
their mission and in order that the new states in
Indochina attain stability and offer their people
a better life, the United States is extending to
them military and economic assistance.

The United States Government hopes that other
free nations will make every contribution within
their power to enable the Associated States and
their partners in the French Union to accomplish
their mission of freedom.
