adequate to make security feasible? This chicken-and-egg argument
has been debated for years without leading to any noticeable consensus
on guides to operational action,

Seeking answers to any of these questions is a difficult, frusÂ«
trating business. There exists no "control" by which laboratory com-
parisons of alternative courses can be made. There is almost surely
no hard choice which will not carry with it very real liabilities
along with its advantages. But if the lives and effort expended in
the U.S. military advisory effort in South Vietnam in the 1960's are
to be justified, a substantial portion of that justification will
consist of a closer examination of past assumptions in order better
to guide future policy.
