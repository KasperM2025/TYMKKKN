sent a message to the President Stressing the importance of RVNAF:

MACV's success (which means the success of the United
States and of all of us) will...willy-nilly, be judged not
Fs{e) much on the brilliant performance of the U.S. troops as
on its success in getting ARV, RF and PF quickly to function
as a first-class counter terror, counter-guerrilla force. 200/

Lodge concluded with a glowing endorsement of Abrams as the man to see
that RVNAF did become an effective force. There is ample evidence that
Abrams did work with great energy to do just that.

In mid-June, after Abrams' first quarterly review of RVNAF, Bunker
included a report on actions to improve RVNAF in his weekly report to
the President;

A) Improving the leadership and enhancing the personnel
effectiveness of the ARVN/RE/PP through such things as
improvement in the awarding of commissions and promotions,
selection procedures, training of officer candidates, the
introduction of an effective personnel management and
accounting system, tightening wp on discipline, improve-
ment in the treatment of veterans in order to clear the
rolls of those incapable of further active duty and an
expanded advisory effort to support properly the Revolu-
tionary Development program;

B) To improve motivation and morale through more equitable
pay scales, improvement in rations, and revitalization of
the dependent housing prosram;

C) Improvement in the command structure and equipment of the
Regional/Popular Forces and a revised motivation and indoc-
trination program to reflect the role of the PF soldier in
Revolutionary Development;

D) A comprehensive training effort to improve intelligence and
reconnaissance operations and to improve the combat effec-
tiveness of battalions; training of ARVN/RF/PF for support
of Revolutionary Development particularly in providing
security and support to the civil population;

E) Experimentation with various forms of integrated US/RVNAF
operations.../discussed already/;

F) Institution of quarterly reviews at which time progress is

Sions taken. First of these reviews was held last month. 201/
