5. After Dien Bien Phu and the withdrawal of most French forces to the

Tonkin Delta, Viet Minh strength in and around the Delta was reported

as 94 infantry battalions, 1 artillery division, 110 district companies,

and from 40,000 to 50,000 militia. French-Vietnamese strength stood
at 109 battalions (of which some 60 percent was VNA) and about 80,000
auxiliary troops and militia. Despite this manpower advantage for
the French Union forces, an intelligence estimate for the period said
they faced possible defections on a mounting scale which could become
very large if the Viet Minh scored major victories or if the French
were believed about to abandon Hanoi and portions of the Delta. See
NIE-63-4-54, "Probable Military and Political Developments in Indo-
china over the Next 30 Days (15 June-15 July)," June 15, 1954 (SECRET).
In General Valluy's report to the five-power military staff confer-
ence on June 4, moreover, he stated there were no southern Vietnamese
who could oppose northern Vietnamese once the Tonkin Delta was lost
and defense of the South became necessary. See Dullesâ€™ tel. TEDUL
