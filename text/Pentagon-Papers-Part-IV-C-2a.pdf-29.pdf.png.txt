DESCRIPTION

Advocating "Air Strikes Against
North Vietnam," the JCS felt NVN
support to insurgents could be re-
duced by armed reconnaissance of
highways leading into Laos, strik-
ing airfields identified with
supporting insurgents, striking
supply, ammunition and POL storage
sites and military installations
connected with PL/VC support. The

. JCS said Hanoi's "military capability

to take action against Laos and the
RVN" would result from hitting
“remaining” airfields, important
railroad and highway bridges, depots
in northern NVN and from aerial
mining and bombing of POL stores

in Hanoi and Haiphong. The Chiefs
also outlined the capability to
effectively destroy the entire

NVN industrial base.

Recommended the U.S. seek to destroy
Hanoi's will and capabilities, as
necessary, to support the insurgency.
They called for "positive, prompt
end meaningful military action" --
mainly air strikes -- to show NVN
"we are now détermined that (its
support to insurgency) will stop"
and to show NVN we can and will make
them incapable of rendering such
support. :

Rusk reported General Khanh's views;

Khanh felt the GVN could not win
against the Viet Cong without some
military action outside its borders;
he wanted insurgent forces in eastern
Laos cleaned out -- by GVN forces

and U.S, air support; he recommended
selected air attacks against NVN
"designed to minimize the chances

of a drastic communist response."

Conferees assessing overall U.S.
policy toward Southeast Asia agreed
with State that the point of depar-
ture "...is- and must be that we
cannot accept (the) over-running of
Southeast Asia by Hanoi and Peking."
