b. Industry

In industry, as compared with agriculture, foreign aid was
more relevant, and visibly more effective. The DRV claimed in 1963 that
new capacity had raised the total value of factory and handicraft industrial
output two and two-thirds times above the 1956 level; an average annual .
increase of some 20%. Socialization was pronounced: by 1963 state-owned
enterprises accounted for 60% of production, and partially state-owned about
6%. The North Vietnamese themselves possessed at the outset little capacity
to carry out a balanced program ofindustrial development; in fact, handi-
capped as the DRV was by annual fluctuations in their agriculturally based
economy and shortages of native technicians, its capability to absorb for-
eign aid was distinctly limited. Initially, to restore existing industrial
plant, to improve communications, and to import consumer goods. Thereafter
aid was extended in the form of credits for specified projects. The first
DRV long range development plan, a three year program in 1958, proved too
ambitious; targets were revised down annually, and at the end of the plan
agricultural growth had averaged a little over #%, compared with 21% for
industry. A Five Year Plan for 1960-1965 was designed for more "rational
development" of heavy industry, but precisely how this was to be achieved,
and the pace of improvement, apparently remained subjects of contention up
until the exigencies of the war overtook the plan.

U.S. intelligence is not informed as to how precisely
foreign aid was related to either DRV economic plans, but in terms of
government budget revenues, the DRV reported that foreign aid and loans
comprised 39.5% of its 1955 income, but dropped to only 15.7% of its
1960 income. By contrast, and as a measure of return on both foreign aid
and its own investment, profits from state enterprises contributed only
6.5% to 1955 income, compared with 58.0% in 1960. Total aid for 1955 to
1963 was as follows:
