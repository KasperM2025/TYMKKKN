Signed by Ho Chi Minh and Marius Moutet.

It will be seen that Ho Chi Minh obtained satisfaction on majority
- of points reported in mytel 4591, September 12.

Boissézon of Foreign Offiee states French generally satisfied with
agreement but would [havel liked to include paragraphs defining
more Mrecisely relations of Viet Nam to Indochinese federation and
French Union. They were also unsuccessful in having written into
agreement provisions for disarmament of resistance elements in
Cochin China but Boissézon claims it was orally understood with Mo
Chi Minh that such elements would have chance of either retiring to
Tonkin with arms and baggage or giving up arms if remaining in
Cochin China.
