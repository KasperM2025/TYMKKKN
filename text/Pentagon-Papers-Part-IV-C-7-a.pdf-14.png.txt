Off-Year Election

With Katzenbach's concurrence,
McNamara recommended only 40,000
more troops and the stabiliza-
tion of the air war. Noting the
inability of the bombing to
interdict infiltration, he
recommended the barrier to the
President. To improve the
negotiating climate he proposed
either a bombing pause or shifting
it away from the northern cities.

The Chiefs disagree with vir-
tually every McNamara recommenda-
tion. In addition they urge an
escalatory "sharp knock" against
NVN.

Carver concurs in McNamara's
assessment of the bombing and
agrees with its stabilization

at about 12,000 sorties per G
month but urges the closing

of Haiphong port.

The President meets with the
heads of government of all the
troop contributing nations and
agreed positions on the war and
the framework of its settlement

are worked out. In a private

conference, Westmoreland opposes
any curtailment of the bombing
and urges its expansion. He
seemed to have reluctantly
accepted the barrier concept.

The Chiefs in forwarding the
CINCPAC force proposals add a
rationale of their own for the
bombing: to "make it as diffi-
eult and costly as possible" for
NVN to continue the war, thereby
giving it an incentive to end it.

In an off-year election, the

peace candidates in both parties
are all resoundingly defeated.
