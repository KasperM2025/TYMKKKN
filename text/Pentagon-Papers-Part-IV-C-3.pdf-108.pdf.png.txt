and will continue fight by their side and we expect they will
also be making maximum efforts in South Viet Nam where a real
setback to Viet Cong would do more than perhaps anything else
to persuade Hanoi stop its aggression.

With initiation ROLLING THUNDER VII we believe publicity
given US and VNAF strikes should be progressively reduced,
although in its place there should be picture of GVN and US
pursuing with regularity and determination program against the
North to enable South restore its independence and integrity
and defend itself from aggression from North. Larger strikes
(ROLLING THUNDER VII A and VII B) be announced as before but
Suggest in future that such announcements not contain references
to Viet Cong atrocities, etc. Instead, these matters, which
should get full attention, might be subject of separate and
perhaps regular press briefings by GVN with full US support.

As regards route recce, we question whether we should take
initiative to announce these missions since this could contri-
bute to impression of substential increase in activity. At
same time we presume reporters will get wind of these missions,
Hanoi will report them and VNAF may not wish maintain silence.
Therefore seems difficult avoid replying to inevitable press
questions. Request PIO meeting opening tomorrow Honolulu to
look into this one and give us and Saigon its recommendations;
possibility it should consider passing off all route recce
missions in low key replies to queries as "routine recce.‚Äù.

ROLLING THUNDER had thus graduated to the status of a regular and

continuing program. What now remained to be more carefully re-examined
-- though hardly resolved -- was the problem of target emphasis.
