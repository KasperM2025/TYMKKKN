forces in the South to 50 tons a day -- too little for
flexibility and for frequent offensive actions, perhaps
4oo little to defend themselves against aggressive us/GVN
forces, and too little to permit Hanoi to continue to
deploy forces with confidence that they could be supplied.

Wot included in the above interdiction program are these
actions against the North:

f. Destruction of industrial targets.
g- Destruction of locks and dams.
h. Attacks on population targets (per se).

The judgment is that, because North Vietnam's economy and
organization is predominantly rural and not highly inter-
dependent, attacks on industrial targets are not likely to
contribute either to interdiction or to persuasion of the
regime. Strikes at population targets (per se) are likely
not only to create a counterproductive wave of revulsion
abroad and at home, but greatly to increase the risk of
enlarging the war with China and the Soviet Union. Destruc-
tion of locks and dams, however -- if handled right -- might
(perhaps after the next Pause) offer promise. It should be
studied. Such destruction does not kill or drown people.

By shallow-flooding the rice, it leads after time to wide-
spread starvation (more than a million?) unless food is
provided -- which we could offer to do "at the conference
table."

7. Nature of resumed program against the North. The
new ROLLING THUNDER program could be:

a. None, on grounds that net contribution to
success is negative.

b. Resume where we left off, with a "flat-line"
extrapolation.

ec. Resume where we left off, but with slow
continued escalation.

d. Resume where we left off, but with fast
escalation.
