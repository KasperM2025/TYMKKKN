5. IN SUM, ANY SERIOUS ESCALATION EXCEPT IN SOUTH VIETNAM WOULD
TRIGGER STRONG SOVIET RESPONSE ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THEY WILL ENDEAVOR
TO AVOID DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH US IN THAT AREA, A PRIOR BOMBING
PAUSE WOULD MITGATE THEIR REACTION TO ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSED EVEN
THOUGH WE MIGHT HAVE TO RESUME AFTER SHORT PERIOD BECAUSE OF INCREAS-

AT START OF NEGOTIATIONS. ANYTHING WE CAN DO THAT WOULD DIMINISH
PICTURE SOVIETS HAVE BUILT UP IN THEIR OWN MINDS OF U.S. PUSUIT OF
WORLDWIDE OFFENSIVE POLICY, AS FOR EXAMPLE PROGRESS TOWARD MIDDLE
EAST SETTLEMENT, WOULD PROBABLY MAKE THEM MORE TOLERANT OF OUR
ACTIONS IN VIETNAM,
