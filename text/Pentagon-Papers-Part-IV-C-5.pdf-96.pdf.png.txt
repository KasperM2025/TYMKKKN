unilaterally cease fire and effect a cessation of incidents,
this would mark end of the interval and end of pressure on .
GVN. Until pressure eases, stability of GVN is a prime con-
cern and objective. Consequently, courses of action examined
are measured as much in terms of their impact on stability and
effectiveness as upon their purely military value, although,
of course, these two matters are closely interwoven.‚Äù

As an adjunct to this, Westmoreland said:

"If basic strategy of punitive bombing in RVN (sic!) does
not take effect by mid-year additional deployments of U.S. and
3rd Country forces should be considered, including introduc-
tion of full MEF into I Corps."

Third, Main VC Capabilities:

"A. Continue with present strategy and build-up and conduct
large attacks whenever favorable.

"B. Above plus a major uprising to break the back of the GVN.

"C. By infiltration, commit PAVN up to a division in the
I/II Corps.

"D. Create peace movement through subversion of existing
organizations; get neutral government established, dominate it,
and sue the North for peace and reunification.

"E. Unilaterally cease firing, causing the U.S. forces to

leave and permitting the covert VC infrastructure to survive
intact.

Courses of action in the Estimate were analyzed in relation to the main
enemy capabilities outlined above. Maximum weight was given to the first
three, which were considered to be the most likely. In addition, the
following considerations formed part of the analysis matrix:
"A. Attainment of critical military objectives of
(1) Security of bases and ports,

(2) Denial of critical areas tu the Viet Cong (areas such
as the highlands of II Corps),

(3) Provision of a quick reaction reserve, and

(4) Provision of a basis for a combined command.
