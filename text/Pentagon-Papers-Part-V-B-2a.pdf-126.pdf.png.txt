The Under Secretary asked Bonnet to call yesterday
afternoon to discuss the situation in Indochina.
Mr. Acheson said that we are Geeply concerned by the out -
break of hostilities in Tonkin and Annam and are fully
aware of the unhappy situation in which the French find
themselves. We had anticipated such a situation de-
veloping in November and events have confirmed our
fears. While we have no wish to offer to mediate under
present conditions we do want the French GOVT to know
that we are ready and willing to do anything which it
might consider helpful in the cireumstances. We have
been gratified to learn of Moutet's mission and have
confidence in his moderation and broad viewpoint. We
believe however that the situation is highly inflammatory
and if present unsettled conditions continue, there is
a possibility that other powers might attempt to bring
the matter up before the Security Council. If this
happens, as in the case of Indonesia, the question will
arise whether the matter is one of purely French internal
concern or a situation likely to disturb the peace.
Other powers might likewise attempt some form of inter-
vention as has been sugzested-in the Chinese press. We
would be opposed to such steps, but from every point of
view it seems important that the question be settled as
soon as possible. Mr. Acheson added that he wondered
whether the French would attempt to reconquer the
country through military force which was a step that the
British had found unwise to attempt in Burma.
