Diem's failure to include Dr.
Quat in the cabinet as Defense
Minister confirmed Collins'
doubts about Diem's capacity

to stabilize the government, or
rally support for his regime.
He recommended Bao Dai's return
be considered, but if this were
unacceptable, recommended the
US withdraw from Vietnam.

Mendes-France insisted the time
had come to consider an alternative
to Diem. Recommended Collins and
Ely study the problem and come
up with suggestions for a change
by mid-January. France felt

Bao Dai should be involved in

an alternative plan. Dulles:
Diem is the only suitable leader
but we will consider alternatives
and will allow Collins and Ely to
consider the matter. But Dulles
made it clear that Congress

would probably not appropriate
funds to a Vietnam without Diem.
U.S. study of alternatives was
cursory, however; Dulles was sure
Diem could succeed, with proper
direction; he was more sure that
no other possible leader existed.

December's despair over Diem

had dissipated; Diem had acted
well on a few matters. Collins
recommended continued support for
Diem because without it South
Vietnam will surely fall to com-
munism and the rest of other
Southeast Asia will soon follow.
The NSC approved Collins' report.
