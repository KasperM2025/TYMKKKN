at the top...These radical changes in the GVN and RVNAF
seem most unlikely to occur without a strong, focused and
coordinated exertion of U.S. influence at high levels...

.

RECOMMEND: ~- That FWMAF give increased emphasis to improv-
ing the performance and conduct of GVN military forces
through combined operations...

~- That as the increase in FWMAF strength permits,
these forces engage with RVNAF in clearing operations in
support of RD with the primary objective of improving the
associated GVN forces...

-- That in view of the deployment and capabilities
of FWMAF in Vietnam and recognizing the necessity for increased
security support to RD, the bulk of ARVN Divisional combat
battalions be assigned to Sector commanders with only those
Divisional battalions not so assigned to be under the control
of Divisions...

-- That the Division be removed from the RD chain
of command...

-- That Ranger units because of their frequently
intolerable conduct toward the populace, be disbanded with
individual Rangers reassigned * ...

-- That RF and PF become Provincial and District
Constabulary...

-- That the Constabulary be placed under the
Ministry of RD...

-- That National Police (Special Branch) assume
primary responsibility for the destruction of the VC "in-
frastructure"...

-- That Police Field Force be integrated into the
Constabulary...

-- That the Vietnamese Information Service (VIS)
terminate its rural information cadre operations and assume
a supporting role...for RD Cadre, technical cadre, and hamlet
officials..." 29/

* This was a recommendation which MACV particularly opposed, arguing
that it "would seriously reduce ARVN combat strength." Westmoreland
added that he could not countenance the disbanding of units which had
just received @ Presidential Unit Citation.
