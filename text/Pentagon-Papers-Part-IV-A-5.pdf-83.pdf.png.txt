U.S. Navy alone moved 310,848 refugees in "Operation Exodus," d/
and although U.S. National Intelligence Estimates in 1955 mention
650,000 refugees from the North, e/ a U.S. Department of State
review of the issue in 1957 put the total at "nearly 900,000;"

the current (1964) National Intelligence Survey refers to "nearly

a million." f/ No better estimate is likely to be taken, given the
paucity of reliable records.
