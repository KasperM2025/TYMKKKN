of any kind on any government willing to talk, nor will we
accept any. On this basis we are ready to begin discussion
next week, tomorrow, or tonight...

To thoce governments who doubt our willingness to talk
â€™ the answer is simple - agree to discussion, come to the
meeting room. We will be there. Our objective in Viet-Nam
remains the same - an independent South Vietnam, tied to
no alliance, free to shape its relations and association
with all other nations. This is what the people of South
Vietnam want, and we will finally settle for no less.

But this is as far as the President was willing to go in his con-
cessions to the Peace Bloc at this time.

To the clamor from many directions, including from Senator Fulbright
and from Canada's Prime Minister Lester Pearson, that the U.S. should
pause in its air strikes to bring about negotiations, the Administration

responded with a resounding "No." Secretary Rusk made the U.S. position
clear on this, in a statement read to news correspondents on April 17:

We have thought long and soberly about suspending, for
a period, the raids on North Viet-Nam. Some have suggested
this could lead to an end of aggression from the North. But
we have tried publicly and privately to find out if this
would be the result, and there has been no response. Others
say such a pause is needed to signal our sincerity, but no
signal is needed. Our sincerity is plain.

If we thought such action would advance the cause of
an honorable peace, we would order it immediately, but now
our best judgment tells us it would only encourage the
aggressor and dishearten our friends who bear the brunt of
battle.
