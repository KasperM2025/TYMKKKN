ANALYSIS

on 5 Avril 1950 the Joint Chiefs of Staff forwarded a

snong other things, that:

"Phe mainland states of Southeast Asia also are at present

of critical strategic importance to the United States because:

"a. They are the major sources of certain strategic
materials reauired for the completion of United States
stockplle projects;

"dD. The area is a crossroad of communications;

"e, Southeast Asia is a vital segment in the line of
containment of communism stretching from Japan southward
and around to tne Indian Peninsula. The security of the
three major non-Communist base areas _in this quarter of
the world--Japan, India, and Austrelia--depends in a large
measure on the denial of Southeast Asia to the Communists.

-If Southeast Asia is lost, these three base areas will tend

to be isolated from one another;

"d. The fall of Indochina would undoubtedly lead to
the fall of the other mainland states of Southeast Asia.
Their fall would:

(1) Require ‘changing the Philippines and
Indonesia from supporting positions in the Asian off-
shore island chain to front-line bases for the de-
fense of the Western Hemisphere. It would also call
for a review of the strategic deployment of United
States forces in the Far East; and

"(2) Bring about almost immediately a dangerous
condition with respect to the internal security of the
Philippines, Malaya, and Indonesia, and would con-
tribute to their probable eventual fall to the com-
munists 5

“"e, The fall of Southeast Asia would result in the
virtually complete denial to the United States of the
Pacific littoral of Asia. Southeast Asian mainland areas
ere important in the conduct of operations to contain
communist expansion;
