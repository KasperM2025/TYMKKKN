North Vietnam's third city, and other towns and cities throughout the

country. 92/ The matter reached a level of concern such that the

President felt compelled to make a statement to the press on December 31

to the effect that the bombing was directed against legitimate military
targets and that every effort was being made to avoid civilian casualties. 93/

At no time in the fall of 1966 is there any evidence that
a second major "pause" like that of the previous year was planned for the
holiday period to pursue a diplomatic initiative on negotiations. But
as the holidays drew near a brief military standdown was expected. The
Chiefs went on record in November opposing any suspension of military
operations, North or South, at Christmas, New Years or the Lunar New
Year the coming February. 94/ The failure of the initiative through
Poland in early December left the U.S. with no good diplomatic reason for
lengthening the holiday suspensions into a pause, so the President ordered
only 48-hour halts in the fighting for Christmas and New Year's. The Pope
had made an appeal on December 8 for both sides to extend the holiday
truces into an armistice and begin negotiations, but this had fallen on
deaf ears in both capitals. 95/ As window-dressing, the U.S. had asked
UN Secretary General U Thant to take whatever steps were necessary to get
talks started. He replied in a press conference on the last day of the
year that the first step toward negotiations must be an "unconditional"
U.S. bombing halt. 96/ This evoked little enthusiasm and some annoyance
in the Johnson Administration.

Thus, 1966 drew to a close on a sour note for the President.
He had just two months before resisted pressure from the military for a
major escalation of the war in the North and adopted the restrained
approach of the Secretary of Defense, only to have a few inadvertent
raids within the Hanoi periphery mushroom into a significant loss of
world opinion support. He was in the uncomfortable position of being
able to please neither his hawkish nor his dovish critics with his care-
fully modulated middle course.

3. 1966 Summary

ROLLING THUNDER was a much heavier bombing program in 1966
than in 1965. There were 148,000 total sorties flown in 1966 as compared
with 55,000 in 1965, and 128,000 tons of bombs were dropped as compared
with 33,000 in the 10 months of bombing the year before. The number of
JCS fixed targets struck, which stood at 158 at the end of 1965, increased
to 185, or 27 snore, leaving only 57 unstruck out of a list of 2he2. gt/
Armed reconnaissance, which was still kept out of the northeast quadrant :
at the end of 1965, was extended during 1966 throughout NVN except for the
Hanoi/Haiphong sanctuaries and the China buffer zone, and beginning with
ROLLING THUNDER 51 on 6 July was even permitted to penetrate a short way
into the Hanoi circle along small selected route segments. Strikes had
