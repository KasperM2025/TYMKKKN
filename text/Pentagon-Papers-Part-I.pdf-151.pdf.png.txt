PARTY or FACTION DESCRIPTION

The Bao Dai Restoration Movements (Continued)

Vietnam Restoration League Revived in 1947, the descendant of
(Viet Nam Phuc Quoc Dong Japanese-oriented nationalist groups,
Minh Hoi) the Phuc Quoc, under Prince Cuong De,

at first attempted to offer an alterna-
tive to both the Viet Minh and Bao Dai.
In June, 1947, and May, 1948, Prince
Cuong De vainly solicited aid from the
President of the United States against
the French, and urged reconciliation
between Ho Chi Minh and Bao Dai. The
party remained chiefly in exile, and
was unable to exert any appreciable
influence over events in Vietnam.

French Sponsored Movements With French encouragement, a number of
Vietnamese parties were formed to give
body to the several governments established
by the French. These included the Indo-
chinese Democratic Party, the Cochin-
chinese Democratic Party, the Popular
Front of Indochina, and the Popular
Movement of Cochinchina. In general,
these parties supported the French poli-
cies of maintaining Cochinchina separate
from Annam and. Tonkin, and of strong
ties with France. Eventually, such
minimal popular support as they commpnded
was thrown behind the "Bao Dai solution.‚Äù
