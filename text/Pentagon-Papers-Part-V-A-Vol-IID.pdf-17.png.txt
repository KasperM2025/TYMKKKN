"In the larger sense this new act of aggression, aimed directly at our
own forces, again brings home to all of us in the United States the impor-
tance of the struggle for peace and security in Southeast Asia. Aggression
by terror against the peaceful villegers of South Vietnam has now been ’
joined by open aggression on the high seas against the United States of
America."

"Ageression -- deliberate, willful, and systematic aggression -- has
unmasked its face to the entire world. The world remembers -- the world
must never forget -- that aggression unchallenged is aggression unleashed.

"We of the United States have not forgotten. That is why we have answered
this aggression with action.

"America's course is not without long provocation.

"For 10 years, three American Presidents -- President Eisenhower, President
Kennedy, and your present President -- and the American people have been
actively concerned with threats to the peace and security of the peoples
of Southeast Asia from the communist government of North Vietnam.

"President Eisenhower sought -- and President Kennedy sought -- the
same objectives that I still seek:

-- That the’ governments of Southeast Asia honor the international
agreements which apply in the area;

-- That those governments leave each other alone;
-- That they resolve their differences peacefully;

-- That they devote their talents to bettering the lives of their
peoples by working against poverty and disease and ignorance.
