TRIPARTITE U.S.-U.K.-FRENCH MEETING

Paris, April 25, 1953

Present: U.S. -- Messrs. Dulles, Wilson, Humphrey, Stassen,
Aldrich, Dillon, Draper.

U.K. -- Messrs. Butler, Lloyd, Alexander, Harvey.

French -- MM. Bidault, Pleven, Letourneau, Parodi.

{Secretary Dulles said that President Eisenhower in his
recent speech] mentioned the end of direct and indirect
attacks on Indochina, so that the armies released in Korea
will not strike elsewhere. We must recognize that here
we are dealing with a more complicated situation, be-
cause the conflict in Indochina has not yet fully received
the status of an international war or an international

act of aggression. In this connection, the Secretary
thought it wise if at some appropriate time the French
government were to give consideration to the possibility
of a complaint being made by Laos or by France, or jointly
by both, in the Security Council, about the invasion of
Laos. This would give the conflict more international
standing and would make it more readily a subject for
international negotiation and settlement, which it is

not today.

With respect to a complaint to the Security Council
by Laos or by France or by both, the British government
would follow the wishes of the French government. As
regards a Korean armistice, Mr. Lloyd felt his govern-
ment would be completely in agreement with the line the
U.S. Government or the UN Command were taking, namely
that we cannot have an indefinitive prolongation of
those talks. However, if there is a possibility of the

leopy held in S/S-R.
