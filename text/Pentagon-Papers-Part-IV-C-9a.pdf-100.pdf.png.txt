The message concluded with a request for modification of the letters of
instructions on use of U.S. troops.

A minor note, not unrelated to combined command, was raised in
May when Prime Minister Quat pressed within GVN for a status of forces
agreement. The matter arose because of concern about Vietnamese sovereignty
over areas where U.S, forces were stationed. Relations were being governed
by the 15 year old Pentalateral agreement, clearly inapplicable to the
present situation. U.S, military forces in Vietnam were enjoying virtual
diplomatic immunity; so the MACV senior judge advocate developed arguments
to demonstrate that raising the issue was not in the interests of either
government. They were passed to the SVN source of the information for
use at ministerial meetings on the subject. There is no indication that
GVN formally discussed status-of-forces with the Embassy.

6. The Ky Coup, June, 1965

After extended negotiations between Quat, Suu, and other leaders
failed to end the government crisis that started in late May, on June 9
Quat asked the generals to mediate the dispute. They did. On June 12
they forced Quat to resign and took over the government. After several
days of jockeying among themselves, the generals formed a National Leader-
ship Council of ten members and made Ky Prime Minister. Taylor was out of
town at the critical time, and the Embassy found out about the main de-
cisions after they were taken. However, Taylor was back in time to object
unsuccessfully to Ky's appointment as Prime Minister before it was announced.
Once things had settled down and the USG felt it had no choice but to accept
the new government, Taylor cabled State:

",..It will serve our best interests to strengthen,
support and endorse this goverrment." 3)
