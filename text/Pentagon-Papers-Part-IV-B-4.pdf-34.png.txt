Nonetheless, there were still further refinements made. As finally
published, the approved MAP reflecting the Model M Plan version of the
CPSVN provided for the following SVN active military strength levels (in

This final product represented a radical reduction in both force levels and
financial investment after FY 66, consistent with the Administration's
original policy goal of, ending the war and the U.S. military involvement

Meanwhile, planning for the 1000-man withdrawal directed by the
Secretary of Defense on 6 May was split off from the CPSVN proper and

JCS, concurring in the proposed plan developed by COMUSMACV and CINCPAC,
forwarded it to the Secretary of Defense. They recomnended approval at
this time for planning purposes only; final decision was to depend upon
circumstances as they developed. The JCS also seconded CINCPAC's added
proposal to withdraw the 1000 troops in three or four increments, rather
than all at one time. The reasons given were that this would be more
practical and efficient for the U.S., would minimize the impact on on-going
military operational activities within South Vietnam, and would afford the
opportunity for “news prominence and coverage over an extended period of
time." 28/

ISA, with certain reservations, recommended approval of the withdrawal
plan submitted by JCS. ISA pointed out to the Secretary of Defense that the
plan as it stood would not draw all of the 1000 troops fron U.S. units that

purpose of the withdrawal might backfire in press reaction. ISA also recom-
mended, in order to show credibly that the final year-end U.S. in-country
