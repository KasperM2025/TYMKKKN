his plans for a prompt solution of the Indochinese problem had failed
and that mich time and effort still remained to be expended.

The appointment of M. PIGNON as successor to M,. Bollaert came as
a great surprise since his name had not even been mentioned among the
numerous candidates for the position: (The two most talked of were
General MAST, former Governor of Tunis, and General CATROUX, a former
Governor of Indochina and recently French Ambassador to Moscow).
Pignon is a career colonial official just over 40 years of age who
has spent most of his service in Indochina. In 1948 he had been
Commissaire de la Republique (provincial governor) for Cambodia when
he was called to Paris for a responsible job in the Ministry of Over-
seas France. His appointment is generally considered as indicating
the intention of the Cabinet to keep closer control over developments
in Indochina.

The new High Commissioner spent the first weeks after his ap-
pointment in Paris, arrived in Saigon on November 21, and returned to
Paris on December 11, 1948. His brief stay in Indochina was chiefly
occupied in bolstering up the tettering Xuan Government. A more
detailed account of his activities since assuming office will be found
in the main section of this paper.
