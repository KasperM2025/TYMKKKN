with the DRV plus help in rebuilding
after the war if they will cease
aggression.

DRV Foreign Minister, Pham Van Dong,
announces his four points for a Viet-
nam settlenent. They are a defiant,
unyielding repudiation of Johnson's
offer.

McGeorge Bundy informs Taylor that
further increments of troops are being
considered, plus use of US Army civil
affairs personnel.

Taylor takes angry exception to the
proposal to increase troops and to
introduce military civil affairs per-
sonnel into the provinces. He did not
think he had agreed on 1 April to a
dand war in Asia.

In a hastily called conference, McNamara‚Äù
informs Taylor in detail of the new polic
directions and "brings him along." An
attempt is made to mollify him.
