Any added requirements in your refined troop list including
deferred units should be fully justified and accompanied by
corresponding civilianization or trade-off spaces.

The additional out-of-country forces proposed in
JCSM 218-67 are not approved except for the 5 additional
destroyers for gunfire support. These destroyers are
approved providing they can be made available from existing
active fleet assets. In addition, I am considering the
activation and deployment of 1 battleship in a separate action.

This was in the ratification of Program 5 which was to be formally pub-
lished on 14 august. 7h/

The final decision in mid-August came as no surprise to either
the public or to the Secretaries or to anyone included in the distribu-
tion of the finished program for that matter, for in his tax budget
message to Congress on 4 August President Johnson had disclosed plans
to dispatch between 45 and 50,000 troops to Vietnam bringing the total
to 525,000. A New York Times article noted that it was a "compromise

from some of the nations which had already contributed or those which
were being reluctant to contribute more. Their return on 6 August only
increased the public pressure for they reported "wide agreement among
allies fighting in South Vietnam to increasing pressure on the enemy."
A day later, Johnny Apple's article on "stalemate" broached the subject
in the public press. In it, Apple outlined in consumate detail the
infiltration figures showing that the United States was failing to
"win" the big war because of the ability of the North Vietnamese to rein-
force faster than we could kill them; he quoted the infiltration statistics
both official and those which he had derived from his time in Vietnam
from "unofficial sources," all quite accurate. He cited the constant
need for reinforcements as a measure of our failure. The article which
received wide circulation both in Vietnam and especially in the decision-
making circles of the Pentagon merely confirmed what many had been saying
officially and unofficially for some time -- that infiltration was a-
