FOOTNOTES

Draft Memorandum for the President, Subject: Future Actions in
Vietnam, 19 May 1967. A series of drafts revealed that McNaughton
had been working on the basic memorandum since late April or early
May. The drafts as they took shape began to incorporate not only
the views of the CIA which we mentioned, especially those related
to the effects of the bombing in the north and the so-called ratchet
effect, where actions in the bombing in the north were having little
effect on the outcomes in the south, the views of the State Depart-
ment, such as those incorporated in the Bundy memo on the bombing,
and even those of the White House, primarily ones prepared at

Walt Rostow's direction. Throughout the period, the same basic

six arguments continued to be developed and expanded until they
appear in the finished document on 19 May. See Memorandum dated

16 May 1967, Subject: Arguments Opposing Further U.S. Forces for
South Vietnam (McNaughton papers -- draft prepared for 19 May DPM);
and McNaughton papers - hand written draft, subject: Issues to

Add to Paper, dated 5 May 67.
