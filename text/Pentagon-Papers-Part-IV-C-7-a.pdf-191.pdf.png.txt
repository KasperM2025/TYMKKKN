-Â».reducing the ability of North Vietnam to support
the Communist insurgencies in South Vietnam and Laos,
and...increasing progressively the pressure on NVN to
the point where the regime would decide that it was too
costly to continue directing and supporting the insurgency
in the South. 42/

After rehearsing the now familiar military failure of the bombing to
halt the infiltration, the report crisply and succinctly outlined the
bombing's failure to achieve the critical second objective --the
psychological one:

---initial plans and assessments for the ROLLING
THUNDER program clearly tended to overestimate the
persuasive and disruptive effects of the U.S. air strikes
and, correspondingly, to underestimate the tenacity and
recuperative capabilities of the North Vietnamese. This
tendency, in turn, appears to reflect a general failure
to appreciate the fact, well-documented in the historical
and social scientific literature, that a direct, frontal
attack on a society tends to strengthen the social fabric
of the nation, to increase popular support of the existing
government, to improve the determination of both the
leadership and the populace to fight back, to induce a
variety of protective measures that reduce the society's
vulnerability to future attack, and to develop an increased
capacity for quick repair and restoration of essential
functions. The great variety of physical and social counter-
measures that North Vietnam has taken in response to the
bombing is now well documented in current intelligence
reports, but the potential effectiveness of these counter-
measures was not stressed in the early planning or intelli-

gence studies. 43/

Perhaps the most trenchant analysis of all, however, was reserved for
last as the report attacked the fundamental weakness of the air war
strategy -- our inability to relate operations to objectives:

In general, current official thought about U.S. objec-
tives in bombing NVN implicitly assumes two sets of causal
relationsiips:

1. That by increasing the damage and destruction of
resources in NVN, the U.S. is exerting pressure to cause
the DRV to stop their support of the military operations
in SVN and Laos; and
