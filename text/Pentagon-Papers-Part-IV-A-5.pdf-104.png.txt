3- The Hoa Hao

Southwest of Saigon there existed the Hoa Hao, a néwer
sect, similarly endowed with politico-military autonomy, which repeat-
edly clashed with the Cao Dai and.the Binh Xuyen. 7/ In 1939, a
mystic faith healer named Huynh Phu So, from a village named Hoa Hao,
launched a reformed Hinayana Buddhist movement which swiftly acquired
a wide following. (Among the Vietnamese whon Huynh Phu So favorably
impressed was Ngo Dinh Diem.) Huynh Phu So enjoyed Japanese protection,
and with their aid, in 194% the Hoa Hao formed armed bands, among the
leaders of which there was one Tran Van Soai. A Viet Minh attempt to
gain the assistance of the Hoa Hao failed, and the Viet Minh on 8 September
1945 massacred hundreds of Hoa Hao faithful in the town of Can Tho. Tran
Van Soai replied in kind, and in the ensuing weeks Can Tho became the |
center of extensive slaughter. French intervention stopped the violence,
but turned the Hoa Hao against the French. In April, 1947, the Viet
Minh executed Huynh Phu So, which caused Tran Van Soai to rally with
2,000 armed men to the French. He was accepted into the French Expedi-
tionary Corps with the rank of general, and assigned the mission of
pacifying his own region. The French from that time forward, until
1955, paid the salaries of the Hoa Hao-soldiers. At the time Diem came
to office in 1954, the sect had some 1,500,000 believers, controlled most
of the Mekong Delta region, and had 10,000 to 15,000 men under arms.
