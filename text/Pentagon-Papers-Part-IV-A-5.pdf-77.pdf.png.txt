"The American Colonialists Are the Most Dangerous Enemy of the People." 122/
The commentary castigated the American Friends of Vietnam for supporting
Diem in "his sabotage of the Geneva Accords and opposition to the clauses
relative to free general elections to unify the country. It is obvious

that this association is an organization formed by the American imperi-
alists to more cynically and bluntly intervene in the South...." and

However, July 20, 1956, the date the Geneva Conference had indi-
eated for the plebescite on reunification, passed without incident.
Years later, when controversy over the failure of the Geneva Settlement
raged anew, the U.S. would point to the subsequent behavior of the DRV
to demonstrate that its judgment was quite correct in arming the GVN,
aiding the refugees, and insisting with Diem that conditions permitting
free elections did not exist in North Vietnam. 123 But in that summer
of 1956, most such arguments appeared to be settled to the satisfaction
of all parties except Ho Chi Minh.
