The Fatherland Front follows the format of the Lao Dong Party, and
Party members occupy the key positions within the Front. The Front
composition has not been changed since 1955, but after 1960 it became
more active in the "reunification" movement, serving as the proponent,
or "externalizing agent" in the DRV for the National Front for the
Liberation of South Vietnam. 13/

It should be noted that the Fatherland Front included two
nominally non-comunist parties, and that it advocated beginning in 1999
an interestingly different scheme for bringing about eunification of
Vietnam: two legislative assemblies for North and South, respectively,
separate armed forces, and a confederate government. But on all ge
issues the Front differed not at all from Ho, especially agreeing that:
"American imperialism is the chief enemy." 1h/ No other deviant view
is on record from either the Front or the two "independent political
parties. Moreover, while the DRV government has on rare occasions :
included Socialist or Democrats, none has ever occupied an important
leadership position.

The most remarkable aspect of the DRV and the Lao Dong ie
Party is stability of their leadership. Most of the top leaders of the
Party were old-time comnaunists.
