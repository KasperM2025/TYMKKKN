DESCRIPTION

Ambassador Taylor reports greatly
increased infiltration from the
North, including North Vietnamese
regulars, and a steadily worsen-
ing situation in the South.

The JCS urge Secretary McNamara to
back military measures to seize
control of the border areas of South
Vietnam and to cut off the supply and
direction of the Viet Cong by direct
measures against North Vietnam.

On the basis of the new intelligence
on infiltration levels, the JCS

again recommend direct military pres-
sures against the North.

In a daring strike, the Viet Cong
staged a mortar attack on the large
U.S. airbase at Bien Hoa, killing
four Americans, destroying five

B-57s, and damaging eight others.

Concerned about possible further
North Vietnamese escalation and the
uncertainty of the Red Chinese re-
sponse, the White House decides,
against the advice of Ambassador
Taylor, not to retaliate in the tit-
for-tat fashion envisaged by NSAM
314. As a result of the attack, how-
ever, an interagency Working Group
of the NSC is established to study
future courses of U.S. action under
the Chairmanship of William Bundy,
Assistant Secretary of Stete for
Far Eastern Arfairs.

Tran Van Hiong is named Premier in
