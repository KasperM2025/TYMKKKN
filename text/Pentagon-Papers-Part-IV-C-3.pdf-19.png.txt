ROLLING THUNDER VII

DESCRIPTION

ROLLING THUNDER VI is authorized for
the next day; it is subsequently de-
layed until the lth because of
weather.

In his reply to Tito the President
indicates the only bar to peace is
DRV aggression which must stop

â€˜before talks can begin.

Taylor complains about the postpone-
ment of RT VI, stating that too much
attention is being paid to the speci-
fic target, any target will do since
the important thing is to keep up the
momentum of the attacks,

Tito calls a meeting of 15 non-
aligned nations in Belgrade. The
declaration calls for negotiations
and blames "foreign intervention"
for the aggravation of the situation,

The delayed RT VI is carried out and
is the heaviest attack thus far with
over 100 U.S, aircraft and 2) VNAF
planes hitting two targets.

Gen, Johnson submits a 21-recommenda-
tion report including a request that
the scope and tempo of strikes against
the North be increased and that many
of the restrictions on the strikes be

Lifted.

Having reviewed the Johnson report,
the President approves most of his |
recommendations including those for
expanding and regularizing the cam-
paign against the North. The new
guidelines apply to RT VII on 19 Mar,

The first week's program of sustained
bombing under the name ROLLING
THUNDER VII begins.
