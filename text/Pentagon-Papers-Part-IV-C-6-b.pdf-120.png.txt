3- MACV be directed to submit a plan by the same
date, to increase the effectiveness of approved US and
FWMAF forces. This should include consideration of changes

the JCS and OSD of possible steps to reduce the cost of
our efforts in SHA. The conflict is almost certainly

to support such an effort for an extended period of time
we must hold the costs to an acceptable level. 10/

The draft included two tables, one a summary of deployments to

Southeast Asia and the other a breakout of the additional MACV require-
ments request. These are shown in the tables on pages 111 and 112.
