ASIAN MANDARIN. FOR ONE THING IT ISN'T TRUE, BUT WERE 17 SO THE ONLY

EMPHASIS OF THE MEKONG FLOOD. FLOODS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD ARE AN

OHIO DOES TO ITS TOWNS. NOW AS THE FLOOD WATERS RECEDE IT 1S ALREADY
EVIDENT THAT THIS FLOOD CONFORMS TO THE ASIAN PATTERN, ONE REPEATED

EVERY YEAR IN INDIA. THE MUD VILLAGES WILL SOON GROW AGAIN. SOME UPLAND

RICE VIAS DROWNED BECAUSE THE WATER ROSE TOO RAPIDLY. NEARER THE COAST: THE

PRESSURE ON THE BRACKISH WATER WILL PROBABLY BRING AN OFFSETTING IMPROVEMENT.
NEXT YEAR'S CROP WILL BE MUCH BETTER FOR THE SILT.

RESULT OF RECENT MOVES AND SECOND HOW WE GET OUT WITHOUT A TAKEOVER. WE

MAKE APPRECIASLE DIFFERENCE.
IN MY COMPLETELY CONSIDERED VIEW, AS STATED YESTERDAY, O1EM

q WILL NOT REFORM EITHER ADMINISTRATIVELY OR POLITICALLY IN ANY EFFECTIVE
