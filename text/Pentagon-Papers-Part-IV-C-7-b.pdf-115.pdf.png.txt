MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject: Increased Pressures on North Vietnam (U)

1. (U) Reference is made to:

a. NSAM 288, dated 17 March 1964, subject: "Implementation
of Soutn Vietnam Program (U)."

b. JCSM-982-64, dated 23 November 1964, subject: "Courses
of Action in Southeast Asia (U)."
ay

c. JCSM-811-65, dated 10 November 1965, subject: "Future
Operations and Force Deployments with Respect to the War
in Vietnem (U)."

2. (U) The purpose of this memorandum is to identify those
military actions consistent with present policy guidelines which
would serve to increase pressures on North Vietnam (NVN), thereby
accelerating the rate of progress toward achievement of the US
objective in South Vietnam.

3. (TS) The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that NVN is paying
heavily for its aggression and has lost the initiative in the
South. They further consider that many factors-~though not
uniform nor necessarily controlling--indicate a military trend
favorable to Free World Forces in Vietnam. South Vietnam, in
the face of great difficulty, is making slow progress on all
fronts--military, political, and economic, However, pace of
progress indicates that, if acceleration is to be achieved, an
appropriate increase in military pressure is required.
