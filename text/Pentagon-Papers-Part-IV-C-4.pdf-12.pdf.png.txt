DESCRIPTION a

In a discussion of proposed U.S. air and
naval action to increase pressure on~
North Vietnam, Taylor told State that as
a hedge against the failure of the GVN
to do its part, the U.S. "should raise
the level of precautionary military
readiness (if not already done) by tak-
ing such visible measures as introduc-
ing U.S. Hawk units to Da Nang and
Saigon, /and/ landing a Marine force

at Da Nang for defense of the airfield
and beefing up MACV's support base...."

The National Intelligence Board expected
the political situation in South Vietnam
to continue to decay, the war effort
gradually peter out and the Vietcong

to seek a neutralist coalition which
they could easily dominate. Two latent
strengths of the GVN were cited; the

-endurance of the people and the ability

ofâ€œadministrators to carry out routine
tasks without guidance from Saigon.

Convening a new group on Southeast Asia,
Bundy mentioned three courses of action
open to the U.S. in Vietnam -- none of
which involved the use of U.S. ground
troops except in response to overt
CHICOM/DRV attacks as called for by
CINCPAC OPLANS 32-64 and 39-65.

William Bundy said he did "not envisage
the introduction of substantial ground
forces into South Vietnam or Thailand
in conjunction with these initial
actions" -- the three courses of action
then under study. The use of U.S.
ground troops for base security was

not mentioned although sending a multi-
lateral force to northern SVN was sug-
gested.

' This first JCS proposal for sending

U.S. ground troops to Vietnam suggested
Marines go to Da Nang, other ground
troops to Tan Son Nhut Airbase for
security and deterrence.
