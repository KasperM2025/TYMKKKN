Memo from Mr. Richard Steadman for Asst SecDef (ISA) McNaughton,

Subj: Additional Deployments to SVN, dated 2 May 67; Memo from

Mr. Wm. Bundy for Undersecretary Katzenbach, Subj: Thoughts on

Strategy in Vietnam dated 1 May 1967.

Ibid. Ambassador Sullivan's opposition to expanding operations in

laos was clearly laid out in a 1 May memorandum addressed to Katzenbach.
In this memo he strongly opposed Westmoreland's HIGH PORT proposal as
well as any expansion of the northern barrier which would either cut
into Lao territory or if it operated as a hermetical seal to the north
would force the North Vietnamese to make an end run through the Laotian
corridor to the west of the barrier. He based his objections primarily
on the serious political consequences which he believed might involve
the withdrawal of Souvanna's collaboration on many other matters of
importance to the U.S. He believed that for the limited operational
advantages on the Ho Chi Minh Trail (none of which he believed would
succeed anyway) that the U.S, would probably lose the entire Mekong
Valley. Quoting President Kennedy, he described this as trading "an
apple for an orchard." See: Memo from Ambassador Sullivan for Mr.
William Bundy, Subject: Limitations on Military Action in Laos, dated

Tbid.
