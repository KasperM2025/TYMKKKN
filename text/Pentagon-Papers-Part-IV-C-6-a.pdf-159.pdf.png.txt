See MACV 5241), Subj: "Military Planning and Progress in SVN," dated
8 December 1966. This message extends MACV 061300Z November 1966,
same title. This plan, transparently an effort to get the GVN offi-
cially on the line for emphasis upon revolutionary development, in
COMUSMACV's eyes incorporated two significant innovations:

"...First, the plan requires RVNAF and MACV subordinate
commands to prepare supporting plans to accomplish the
Objectives, tasks and goals stated in AB 142 and to support
the achievement of goals stated in provincial revolutionary
development (RD) plans. These plans are to be submitted
for review by 15 December. Second, to maintain the viable
nature of this plan, a requirement for quarterly reviews has
been incorporated. These reviews will cover progress made,
problems encountered, and recommendations for improvement.
A combined RVNAF/MACV directive is being developed which
establishes procedures for these reviews..." (See: MACV 341,
080245Z December 1966)
