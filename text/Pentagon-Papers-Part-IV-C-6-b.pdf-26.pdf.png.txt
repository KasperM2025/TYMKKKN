The memorandum was directed toward a rethinking of strategic concepts --
in that it failed. It seemed to resolve the problem of achieving a unified
strategic concept by leaving the same undefined. As long as the crucial
force deployment and political settlement questions could be deferred, a
concept sufficiently ambiguous or undefined appeared to be the best one to
preserve harmony and encourage continued support. However, the memorandum
was useful to point up a basically faulty premise about ARVN effectiveness
in the pacification/security mission. If they were inadequate to assess
the pacification task, as Katzenbach's staff contended, then our strategy
and our manpower requirements could become quite different than was origi-
nally calculated as we pursued the elusive objective of "winning the war."
As he astutely pointed out, the cleavage between the mainforce and guerrilla
wars was more imagined than real, and we could not hope to win them seri-
ally ~-- they had to be controlled simultaneously or failing that, probably
not at all. All of the clues were there, it only remained for someone to
articulate the fear that so many decision-makers held -- massive U.S.
forces, engaged in every activity, provided the only reasonable probability
of "winning" in Vietnam.

The NSAM effort was abortive. ho/ The evident division in DoD over
the concept and objectives coupled with State's lukewarm response to pro-
ducing any clear definition of ains/concepts convinced the White House
that the best way to retain flexibility in South Vietnam and at home was
to allow the ambiguity and uncertainty to continue.
