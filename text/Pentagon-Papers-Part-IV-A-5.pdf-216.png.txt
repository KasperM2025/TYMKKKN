the DMZ into Quang Tri and Thua Thien. 11u1/ In April, 1959, a prisoner
reported that the Lao Dong Party Central Committee directed the forming

of a headquarters to control this effort, which came into being on May SY,
1959, as the 559th Transportation Group, directly subordinate to Party
headquarters. 112/ Another prisoner served with the 70th Battalion of
the 559th Group, which was formed in 1959 and sent into southern laos.

The 7Oth Battalion received weapons, ammunition, mail, and supplies from
Hanoi and transported them to another organization in charge of distribution
to insurgent units. The 7Oth Battalion was in charge of 20 way-stations,
furnished escorts for infiltrating groups from North to South Vietnam, and
transported sick and wounded personnel from Thua Thien Province back to
North Vietnam. 113/ While the 559th Group was being deployed on land,
other prisoners reported that the 603d Battalion was formed in June, 1959;
to manage maritime infiltration into South Vietnam. 114/ According to
prisoners, the 603d Battalion had 250 men upon formation, and by December,
1959, had 11 infiltration "cells" and supporting bases in operation.

Still other POWs stated that in January, 1960, a training
center for infiltrators was in operation at Son Tay, northwest of Hanoi,
and that in early 1960, the NVA 324th Division in Nghe An was directed
to begin infiltrator training. 115/ About the same time the Xuan Mai
Infiltration Center was established southwest of Hanoi, a school which
by 1961 could accommodate several 1000-man classes simultaneously. 116/

Moreover, available evidence points to 1959 as the year in
which significant numbers of regroupees began to be funneled from North
Vietnam through the way-station system into South Vietnam. George Carver,
of CIA, has conservatively estimated that 1959 infiltration amounted to a
“Pew hundred.” 117/ Altogether, during 1959 and 1960, twenty-six groups
of infiltrators, comprising 4500 personnel, were confirmed by interrogations
of two or more prisoners from each group. 118/ The same sources estab-
lished that most of the infiltrators were military officers, senior non-
commissioned officers or trained political cadre. Captured documents and
interrogations also indicate that at least half--military and civilian--were
regular lao Dong Party members. The following table shows U.S. intelligence
estimates of infiltration into South Viet-Nam from 1959 through 1965; during
1963 "regroupee" resource waned visibly, and in 1964 apparently dried up; by
early 1965 at least three out of four infiltrators were ethnic North Viet-
namese. 119/
