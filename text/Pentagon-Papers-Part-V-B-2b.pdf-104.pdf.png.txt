DEPT has viewed growing signs of POLIT and MIL de- !
terioration in Indochina with increasing concern. The —
failure of the Vietnam GOVT and its leaders to inspire
support, the slow pace of the Pau CONF and inability or
disinclination of Bao Dai to assume leadership as exempli-
fied by his prolonged stay in FR are among disturbing
POLIT factors. Of even greater immediate import are MIL
considerations - the increasing indications of CHI COMMIE-
Viet Minh military collaboration and ever present threat
of CHI invasion.

Whatever prompt action we can take ourselves or recom-
mend to FR to stem unfavorable tide must bear FOu objectives
in mind: 1) Have sufficient dramatic impact to stir all
factions of Vietnamese POLIT thought, preferably to extent
of swaying fence sitters;

2) Serve to repudiate claim that FR are not sincere
in implementing MAR 8th Accords and are using “independence
within FR Union" as a cloak for colonialism;

3) Have sufficient psychological attraction to na-
tionalists to appease, at least temporarily, their hunger
for further evidences of autonomy;

4.) Will not in any way jeopardize the already inade-
quate FR and allied MIL potential in Indochina;

5) Attract other potential non-COMMIE combatant units
(Cao Daists, Hoa Hao, Catholics) to side of FR Union
troops};

6) Cause no further depletion of West EUR MIL poten-
tial and even improve it by releasing FR troops from ser~-
vice in IC.
