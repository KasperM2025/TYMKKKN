(ec) Greatly Expand the US Advisory Structure, .
Especially with RF/ PF. Here's another quick way to get more
for our money. In some cases the troop to advisor ratio in
RF/PF is 1,000 to 1. Only 1,200 advisors (the strength of
one USMC maneuver battalion) might have many times the payoff.

(ad) Expand RVNAF as a substitute for more US
forces. Westy wants 50,000 more RF/PF in FY 1966. Let's
consider 100,000 in a two-phase expansion.

(e) Increase RVNAF pay, housing, ration, and other
incentives. Bull through a better promotion policy. The

savings from cutting back on non-productive units and expendi-
tures might finance much of the increase.

(f) Enrich RVNAF equipment. I'm told the rifles
and carbines are poor, that more radios for RF/PF would help
greatly, that new equipment would build up morale and effective-
ness.

A crash program along the above lines would be cheap at
the price, in fact so cheap that we probably ought to do most
of it anyway. Piaster and manpower constraints are manageable
in my view.

2. Expand civilian pacification programs along similar

lines:

(a) We're turning out RD teams about as fast as
feasible. So supplement them with â€œinstant RD teams" on model
of civil/military team in Binh Dinh.

(>) Even 4) more US advisors for RD teams would make
a big supervisory difference. Ditto for 50 more US advisors for
the police.

(c) Give RD teams and police all the equipment they
need--rrom military stocks.

(ad) Integrate the US advisory effort on pacification
to provide a new forward thrust.

(e) Press harder for removal of incompetent or cor-
rupt province and district officials.
