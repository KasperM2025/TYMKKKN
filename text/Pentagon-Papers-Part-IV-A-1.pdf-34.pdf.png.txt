(1) Iaos Planning

A modification of Plan #5 existed under the temporary
title of "Plan 5-plus," drafted by the JCS in September 1961 as a pro-
posed contingency plan for intervention in Iaos. In this concept,
25,400 troops would be sent into Iaos. The force would consist of the
following: 64

Country In Laos Support and Reserves
U.S. 5, 500 11,000
Thailand : 11,400 3, 300
Commonwealth 4,400 3,500

(UK, Australia, NZ)

Pakistan 1,400 1,700
Philippines 200

GVN 2,700

These troops would augment the Royal Laos forces of 38,500 in the Regu-
lar Army, 11,000 Meos, and 29,800 other defense forces. In this modifica-
tion of Plan 5, it was assumed that the Royal Laotian Government would
appeal to SEATO for assistance. This would initiate an airlift of SEATO
forces into key points along the Mekong River at Vientiane, Paksane,
Thakkek, Savannakhet, and Pakse. These forces would support the Royal
Iaotian troops against communist forees in the areas of northern Laos
bordering on Thailand and from all of the Iaotian panhandle. At the

same time, Thai forces would operate around Iuang Prabang and GVN eroeps
would operate along the GVN-Laos border. 65/
