Ho Chi Minh Chronology

On 19 May born Nguyen Van Thanh, youngest son of three children
of Nguyen Tat Sac, a minor government official and revolutionary,
in Kim Lien Village, Nghe An Province, Annam (Central Vietnam).

Attended village school and French lycee at Vinh (14 miles from
Kim Lien). Carried messages for anti-French underground. Noted
for his political tirades (Fall).

(Russo-Japanese War. Japanese victory greatly influenced Viet-
namese political developments.)

Dismissed from school for reasons of politics (NVN historians),
or poor grades (teachers).

Transferred to Llycee Quoc Hoc, a prestigious high school, in

Hue. Quoc Hoc was a hotbed of Vietnamese resistance to outside
influence; among its graduates were Ngo Dinh Diem, Vo Nguyen Giap,
and Pham van Dong. (To this day, the students of Hue continue

to strongly influence Vietnamese politics, e.g., Hue riots against

Ky in 1966.)

Left school without a diploma; taught school at Lycee Dac-Thanh
in Phan-Thiet. Left Phan Thiet in October to attend trade
school (probably cooks and bakers) in Saigon.

Worked as messboy aboard French liner SS Le Touche-Treville on
Saigon-Marseille run. Ho carried letter of introduction to
Phan Chu Trinh, prison mate of Ho's father at Poulo Condore
and veteran nationalist of Dong Bao (Haircutters ) movement in
1907. Failing to accept Trinh's nationalism, Ho returned to

| working on liners travelling the world.

| Worked in kitchens of Carlton Hotel in London under Escoffier,
| famous French chef. Joined Overseas Workers Union, a clandestine

anti-colonialist group dominated by Chinese.

(1914-1916 is an obscure period -- sometime during the period
Ho went back to sea and visited New York, later writing on the
U.S. race problem in La Race Noire.)

Ho turned up in Paris, France, to spread influence of anti-
colonialist nationalism to Indochinese conscripted for war
service in France. Communist revolution in Russia under Lenin
which promised national independence for colonials stimulated
Ho to deeper involvement in politics.

Conducted a photograph retouching business and advertised in
Socialist Party's newspaper under the name of Nguyen Ai Quoc
(The Patriot).
