beyond the already-authorized 20,000-
man addition was recommended; a
modest MAAG increase was proposed.
The US would support the Civil Guard
and Self-Defense Corps. Emphasis

was on stabilizing the countryside,
not on pressing Diem for political

or administrative reforms. (Gilpatric
wanted Lansdale to go to Vietnam
immediately after the program was

teams to train each new division;
400 Special Forces troops to speed
over-all ARVN counterinsurgency
training). Rationale: to enable
ARVN to guard against conventional

more US troops but recommended ex-
pansion of ARVN to meet the threat
of increased infiltration. These
