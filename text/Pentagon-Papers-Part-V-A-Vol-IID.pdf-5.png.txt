JOHNSON. ADMINISTRATION - 1964

SUMMARY

President Johnson succeeded to the Presidency upon the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy in November 1963 only three weeks after
the coup d'etat which saw the Ngo Dinh Diem regime crushed and Diem
himself murdered. Confronted with a crisis, the U.S. renewed its
pledge to support the military junta and the free government of
Vietnam. The U.S. increased its support even as the GVN wavered
through a series of government changes each reflecting the control
retained by the military. U.S. involvement deepened with the in-
creased advisory strength and the introduction of combat troops in
1964. The Tonkin Gulf crisis and the subsequent resolution became
benchmarks for the U.S. commitment. The new Administration emphasized
the following points: :

a. Organized agoression from the North obligated the United
States to fulfill its commitments under the SEATO treaty.

b. The strategic importance of Southeast Asia to the security
of the United States and the test of "wars of liberation" there as in-
portant to the future peace and freedom of South Vietnam.

ec. The Gulf of Tonkin action showed that "aggression by
terror" had been joined by “open aggression on the high'seas" against
the United States and the resolution which followed justified measures
to "repel any armed attack."

d. The communist "appetite for aggression” through "wars of
liberation" threatened not only other Asian countries, but also the
United States if left unchecked. The U.S. seeks no wider war.

e. Four basic themes govern U.S. policy, essentially un-
changed since 1954: America keeps her word; the future of Southeast
Asia is the issue; “our purpose is peace; and, this war is a "struggle
for freedom."
