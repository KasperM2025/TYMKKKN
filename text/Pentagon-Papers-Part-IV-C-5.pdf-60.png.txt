The sole bright spot in all of this was the highly touted "Hop Tac” pro-
gram which concentrated resources, human and material, on a few key
provinces around the capital of Saigon. A lot of favorable things were
being said about Hop Tac. McGeorge Bundy told the President in an
apparently pivotal memorandum dated 7 February 1965 that although
American air power would have to be used to buy time for us to break
the Viet Cong hold on the countryside, the Hop Tac program offered

hope for the future. 29/ (See Section I.A. in the Study on The
Re-emphasis of Pacification.) During that 6th of April press conference,
the MACV spokesman told the press that "Hop Tac continues to move along
a plus curve..." 30/

Even without the dogged optimism, it is difficult in the absence of
hard data to accurately assess the real situation in the countryside in
early 1965, or to tell how much of the Hop Tac program was merely bluster
and bravado. In regard to the latter, the Secretary of Defense sent to
the Chairman of the JCS on 4 June 1965 the following query: "How did
the Viet Cong mobilize a battalion to attack Binh Chanh district town
only 10 miles from Saigon in the center of the Hop Tac area?" 31/
Whatever the case, the pacification program was overtaken by events of
May and Jue. Prior to this, the II Corps, including the coastal pro-
vinces of Phu Yen and Binh Dinh and all of the highland provinces, was
already in trouble. 32/

D. Economic Situation

The staple food of the Vietnamese is rice, and Vietnam has in
time of peace traditionally been an exporter of that commodity. The
- Viet Cong campaigned to control the countryside where the rice is grow
and the routes of communication, land and water, over which it is moved
to market. They were so successful that by 1965 the GVN was forced to
contemplate massive imports of rice in order to feed the population and
help stabilize prices. To illustrate the scope of the problem, the
following statistics show rice exports from the district of Thanh Phu to
the capital of its province Kien Hoa, one of the richest of the provinces
in the Mekong Delta: 33/

By early 1965 the current crop of Delta rice had already been
harvested, and it was obvious that the Viet Cong were not going to allow
