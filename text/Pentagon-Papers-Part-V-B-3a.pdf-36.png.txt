192. The French have been lead to believe that Dulles made
an offer of the use of atomic bombs at Dien Bien Phu
and that Bidault was "much upset" by the offer and felt
that they would have done no good tactically. There is
concern that Bidault -- "ill, nervous, hypersensitive
and bitter" might attempt to publicize his version and
take credit for preventing the use of atom bombs as
"suggested by the U.S." Paris 558 to Dulles, 9 August

193. Dulles has “no recollection whatever of the alleged
offer" of atomic bombs to the French and indicates
"it is incredible that I should have made the offer
wees" Dulles 501 to Paris, 9 August 195!...ccceceescecceeces [06

194. On the offer of atomic bombs, the French agree that
there has been a complete misunderstanding, possibly
based on language difficulties. On the day of Dulles
"alleged" offer, Bidault had been “ill, jittery,
overwrought" and, even to the French staff, "incoherent."

195. The JCS review U.S. policy in the Far Rast - NSC 5429.
They recommend that NSC 5429 be returned to the Planning
Board for "exposition of U.S. objectives” and “delinea-
tion of broad courses of action” in the Far East. Ex-
tensive comments by the Army Chief of Staff on NSC 5he9
("It is not a comprehensive review of the entire prob-
len....WE DO NOT HAVE ELTTHER TO APPEASH COMMUNIST CHINA
OR TO DESTROY IT.") are included. JCS Memorandum for

196. The JCS comment on a draft State Department message for
the French Prime Minister regarding U.S. policy toward
Indochina. They feel the message should state clearly
that the assumption of training responsibility in Viet-
nam by the U.S. is contingent on the preconditions stated
in their 4 August memorandim (see Document 185). JCS
