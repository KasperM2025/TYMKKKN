I cannot promise that the initiative that I have announced
tonight will be completely successful in achieving peace any
more than the 30 others that we have undertaken and agreed to
in recent years.

But it is our fervent hope that North Vietnam, after
years of fighting that has left the issue unresolved, will
now cease its efforts to achieve a military victory and will
join with us in moving toward the peace table.

And there may come a time when South Vietnam -- on
both sides -- are able to work out a way to settle their ~
own differences by free political choice rather than by

As Hanoi considers its course, it should be in no doubt
of our intentions. It must not miscalculate the pressures
within our democracy in this election year.

We have no intention of widening this war.

But the United States will never accept a fake solution
4o this long and arduous struggle and call it peace.

No one can foretell the precise terms of an eventual
settlement.

Our objective in South Vietnam has never been the
annihilation of the enemy. It has been to bring about a
recognition in Hanoi that its objective -- taking over the
South by force -- could not be achieved.

We think that peace can be based on the Geneva Accords
of 1954 -- under political conditions that permit the South
Vietnamese -- all the South Vietnamese -- to chart their
course free of any cutside domination or interference, from
us or from anyone else.

So tonight I reaffirm the pledge that we made at Manila --
that we are prepared to withdraw our forces from South Viet-
nam as the other side withdraws its forces to the North, stops
the infiltration, and the level of violence thus subsides.

Our goal of peace and self-determination in Vietnam
is directly related to the future of all of Southeast Asia --
