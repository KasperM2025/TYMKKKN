30. In a talk with Smith June 19, Molotov discussed the Laos and Cambodia
resistance movements and said he saw the possibility of agreement so
long as neither side (i.e., the French or the Viet Minh) "adopted
one-sided views or put forward extreme pretensions.‚Äù Molotov said
about 50 percent of Laotian territory was not controlled by the royal
government (a curious way of putting it), with a much smaller move-
ment in Cambodia. The tone of Smith's report on this conversation
suggests that Molotov saw no obstacles to Viet Minh withdrawal of
its "volunteers." Smith tel. DULTE 202 from Geneva, June 19, 1954
