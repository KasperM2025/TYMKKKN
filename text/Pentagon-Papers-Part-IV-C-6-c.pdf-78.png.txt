In addition, the Secretary indicated that the Chief of Staff of the
Army recomnended:

-.-tvhat one division, its ISI and the station comple-
ment, a total of 37,000 TOR strength, be alerted 15 March
and called up 15 April instead of 15 May in order to provide
an earlier capability to react to the unpredicted, a stronger
STRAF in light of growing uncertainties in Southeast and
Northeast Asia and to assure an earlier improvement of the
sustaining base to support the increased deployments and to
avoid drawdown on Europe. 87/

The approval of an additional 13,500 deployment to support the emer-
gency augmentation was apparently approved very quickly.

In a memorandum for the record on 16 March, the latest tentative plan

for Vietnam Deployments and reserve call-ups were listed as follows by the
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Systems Analysis):

Bit Deployment
Program #5 525,000

Emergency Augmentation 10,500
Support fox 10,500 13,500
Additional Deployment 30,000
Total 579,000
2, The March reserve call, to be announced around 20 March
will be:
Support deployment 36,621
Support personnel for the 10,500 13,437

Total 50,058

The March call will waive the 30 days notice, so troops
will report around March 27.

3. Around a week or 10 days later, "after a study" there will
be a second call of 48,393....These reservists will be given
30 days, therefore reporting around 1 May. 88/

Still, the ‘President was troubled. In public he continued to indicate
firmness and resoluteness, but press leaks and continued public criticism
continued to compound his problem. On March 17, the New York Times, again
amazingly accurate, forecast that the President would ap approve dispatch
of an additional 35,000 to 50,000 men to Vietnam over the next six months.. 89/
On March 18, nearly one-third of the House of Representatives, a total
of 139 members, - 98 Republicans and 41 Democrats - joined in sponsoring a
resolution calling for an immediate Congressional review of the United

States policy in Southeast Asié. 90
