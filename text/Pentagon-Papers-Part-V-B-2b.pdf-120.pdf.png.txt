are weak and inadequate, The absence of artificial
obstacles, demolition plans and adequate mibile re-
serves, adequate aircraft support, and the very small
amount of artillary, which is now disposed so that it
is impracticable to coordinate and mass fires, appear
to be the most outstanding weaknesses in the Tonkin
area, Another important deficiency is to lack of
sufficient personnel now available, Anti-tank defenses
in the Tonkin area are practically non-existent. The
Viet Minh activities in this area will probably prevent
the free movemtnt of such reserves as are now available

3. CIA Estimate of the Prospects for Chinese Communist Action
in Indochina, During 1950 (ORE 50-50, Tf September 1950

"Conmunist China at present possesses the GÂ¢apability for a
successful invasion of Indochina, If Communist China, as a partici-
pant in the world Communist movement, were called upon to invade
Indochina, it could probably be persuaded to initiate such
en operation, Chinese Communist military commitments elsewhere
would not necessarily militate against and invasion of Indochina
because the Chinese Communists posses the forces necessary for
military action - separately or simultaneously ~ against Indochina,
Korea, Taiwen, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macao.

"Despite this general capability and despite the existence
of Chinese Communist military concentrations along the Indochina
border, adequate for the task, it is estimated that an open Chinese
Communist invasion -~ While possible and capable of being
launched with little or no preliminary warning - is. improbable
in 1950 because considerations ( from the standpoint of Ho Chi Minh,
the Chinese Commmnists, and international Communism) favoring
such action appear to be outweighed by considerations opposing it.
It is highly probable, however, that the Chinese Commmists will.
continue to expend military assistance to the Viet Minh forces (by
measures short of open invasion) on a scale sufficient to provide
those forces with the capability of achieving significant, but
limited, objectives in 1950 and assuming that the French receive
no more aid than is presently programmed, of eventually expelling
the French without the aid of a Chinese Communist invasion,"

h, Chinese Communist Military Capabilities (ORE 50-50)

"Any invasion of Indochina by the Chinese Communists would
probably be undertaken in cooperation with the forces of Ho Chi Minh,
, Sizable Chinese Communist military forces are in position
to intervene in Indochina, Despite reports of actual and scheduled
northward movements of certain Chinese Conmunist field forces,
approximately 100,000 trouns remain deployed along the Indochinese
border, These units could launch an invasion of Indochine without
