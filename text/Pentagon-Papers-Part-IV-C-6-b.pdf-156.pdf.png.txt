Ibid. As the third leg of this intensive inter-agency review

of our bombing strategy, Wm. Bundy of Stete prepared an analysis
very similar to that presented by Rostow. He too believed that
our options were essentially those of concentrating on the supply
routes in Route Packages 1 and 2, restrikes north of the 20th
parallel, possible selective additional strikes on sensitive
targets in the North, and finally, a major expansion to extremely
sensitive targets north of the 20th parallel. His examination of
the options concluded that the final option, that is, of not
hitting additional sensitive targets, increasing our reaction in
our effort in Route Packages 1 and 2 were both preferable to the
political consequences of an expansion of the bombing north of
the 20th parallel. In this, he was generally in agreement with
McNaughton. He believed that basically overall progress in the
south was the key element in changing Hanoi's attitude and that
any bombing program below the major expansion option or any
cessation of bombing without certain reciprocity would be totally
negative in its effect on Hanoi. He relegated the bombing program
itself to basically a supplementary role in affecting Hanoi's
attitude. See memorandum from W. P. Bundy, Subject: Bombing
ee Options for the Rest of 1967, dated 8 May 1967 (McNaughton
papers).
