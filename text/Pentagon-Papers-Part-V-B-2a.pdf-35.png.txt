EDITORIAL NOTE: '

With the death of President Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, the
indecisive policy toward Indochina took on a new approach under the
new President, Harry S. Truman, Shortly after being sworn in to
office, U.S. policy was thoroughly reviewed. On 13 April, the State-
War-Navy Coordinating Committee met and discussed the urgent need
for clarification of U.S. policy toward FrenchIndochina, document
number 3, By 20 April, a Memorandum to the President on Indochina
policy had been drafted by the State Department Division of European
Affairs (EUR), documents number 5 and 6, The Division of Far Eastern
Affairs (FE) revised the EUR version to the extent that it was
substantially different from the original submitted, document number 7. -
The final compromise between the two versions resulted in a draft action
cable for Paris and a Memorandum on American Policy with Respect to
Indochina for the President, both of which appear as documents number
9 and 10, The record shows that the policy statements in the memorandum
was neither sent to nor approved by the President and that the cable was
not dispatched to Paris, The documentation concerning this evolvement
of policy is included here as a revelation of the France=-Indochina
commitments internal to the Department of State and the impetus lent to
policy making by the War Department in the latter phase of World War II.
