| Leadership of Vietnam GOVT during this crucial period is a
factor of preponderant importance in deciding ultimate outcome,
COVE must display unusually aggressive leadership end courage be-
fore a discouraged people, distraught and floundering in the wake
of years of civil war, Lesser considerations concerning the
modalities of relations between the States of the FR Union and the
REP of FR must, for instance, be at least temporarily laid aside
in face of serious threat to very existence of Vietnem as autonomou
state, within FR Union or otherwise, é

We are aware (as is Bao Dai) that present Vietnamese GOVT is so
linked with person of Chief of State that leadership and example
provided by latter takes on extraordinary importance in determining
degree of efficiency in functioning of GOVE, Through circimstances
‘of absence in FR of Bao Dai and other Vietnamese leaders for prolonged
-period, opportunity for progress in assumption of responsibilities
from FR and extension authority and influence of GOV? with people
was neglected, Many people, including great number AMERS, have
been unable understand reasons for Zmperor's GTZ prolonsed holiday
UNOTE on Riviera and have misinterpreted it as an indication of
Jack of patriotic attachment to his role of Chief of State, DEPT
is at least of opinion that his absence did not enhance the
authority and prestige of his GOVT at home.

Therefore, DEPT considers it imperative Bao Dai give Vietnamese
people evidence his determination personally take up reing of state
and lead his country into IMMED and energetic opposition COMI
menace, Specifically he SHLD embark upon IMMED program of visits
to all parts Vietnam making numerous speeches and public apperances
in the process, Chief op State SHLD declare his determination plunge
into job of rallying people to support of GOVT and opposition to VM
IMMED upon arrival Saigon, He SHLD-announce US, FR support for
formation NATL armies and his own intention assume role Commander
in Chief, He SHLD take full advantage of FR official declaration
of intention to form NATL armies (confirmed yesterday by MIN ASSC

States Letourneau) and set up precise plan for such formation
