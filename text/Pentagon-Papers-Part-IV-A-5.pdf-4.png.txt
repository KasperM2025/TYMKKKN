ORIGINS OF THE INSURGENCY IN SOUTH VIETNAM, 1954-1960

SUMMARY

From the perspective of the United States, the origins of the
insurgency in South Vietnam raise four principal questions:

1. Was the breakdown of the peace of 1954 the fault
of the U.S., or of the ambiguities and loopholes of the
Geneva Accords?

2. Was the insurgency in essence an indigenous
rebellion against Ngo Dinh Diem's oppressive govern-
ment, transformed by the intervention of first the
U.S., and then the DRV?

3. Or was it, rather, instigated, controlled, and
supported from its inception by Hanoi?

4. When did the U.S. become aware of the Viet Cong
threat to South Vietnam's internal security, and did it
attempt to counter it with its aid?

The analysis which follows rests on study of three corpora of
evidence: .

(a) Intelligence reports and analyses, including the most
carefully guarded finished intelligence, and pertinent National Intel-
ligence Estimates.

(b) Unfinished governmental intelligence, field reports, and
memoranda such as interrogations of prisoners and translated captured
documents, as well as contract studies based on similar evidence.

(c) Qpen sources, including the works of former U.S. officials,
Vietnam correspondents, and the like.

The U.S. has attempted to amplify (c) by publishing White Papers in
1961 and 1965, in which substantial citations were made from (b) and
interpretations offered consistent with (a). This study has benefited
from further effort during 1967 and early 1968 to identify in (b)
evidence which could be publicly released. But, based on the survey
of (a), (b), and (c) reported on below, the U.S. can now present no
conclusive answers to the questions advanced above.
