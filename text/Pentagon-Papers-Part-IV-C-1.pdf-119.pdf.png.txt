They found slow, hard-slugging contest fatiguing to their spirits.
The reprisals of 5 August (Tonkin Gulf) had given them a lift, but
if indecisive bloodshed with the VC continued, they would probably
exert continuing and increasing pressure for direct attack upon
Hanoi. â€”

Concerning pacification, the Ambassador observed that the most
difficult part of the program was the civilian follow-up after the
clearing operation in the clear-and-hold program. The difficulty
stemmed from the inefficiency of the ministries. To energize these
civilian functions, USOM had increased its provincial representation
from 45 in March to 64 in July, but this was still insufficient,
despite the judgment of critical inefficiency in the ministries.
Taylor next reported that "U.S. observers reported in July that in
about 3/4 of the provinces GVN provincial and district officers were

quarrel intensified. Students again began to demonstrate in Saigon and
Hue. By duly a coup plot was developing against Khanh led by his dis-
gruntled Vice Premier, Dr. Nguyen Ton Hoan, who was backed by the Dai
Viet and several top military leaders. But according to one of the
best authorities, known U.S. opposition to a coup made its leaders
hesitate and nothing immediately developed. 115 Then came the Tonkin
Gulf affair of 2-4 August, and the U.S. retaliatory strikes of 4-5
August.

An immediate effect of the raids was to shore up Khanh's weaken-
