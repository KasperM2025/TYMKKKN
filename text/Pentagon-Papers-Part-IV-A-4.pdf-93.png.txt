The key to this problem [the Indochina war] is a strong and effective
Nationalist army with the support of the Populace behind it." Debriefing,
M/General Thomas J. H. Trapnell, Jr., 3 May 1954, in OSD files 092/092.2
Indochina. U.S. dscisionmakers seemed to agree virtually unanimously with
this statement. :

ar April 1953 CHMAAG General Trapnell reported that French observers
had returned from Korea with little but a list of reasons why U.S. training
procedures could not be effectively applied in Indochina. Msg, CHMAAG
Indochina to AC of S G-3 and CINFE, MG619A, DA-IN-257701, 15 April 53.
Although the minutes of the Bipartite U.S.-French Conversations (First
Session, April 22, 1953, 3:30 p.m., Quai d'Orsay) reported that "The
French missions which have been received in Korea were very useful.
Marshall Juin himself hag brought back information the French propose to
use in the formation of the Vietnam army," the qualifiers added, even at
this high diplomatic level ("But the problem is not the same in Indochina
as in Korea. The problems facing the two armies are not comparable, but
some lessons can be applied") lend weight to the Trapnell Interpretation
that the French visits to Korea had been largely a waste of time (S).

Sonis plan, outlined to then Chargé d'Affaires Gullion, was dismissed
as "fantastic," although it was seen that this Vietnamese attitude raised
serious-problems. Msg, Gullion to Acheson, 204, 25 March 1950 (S). History
