This is different from the idea that
American involvement should be so
intimate that the GVN would be re-
formed "from the bottom up" -- i

from Cottrell, the Taylor Report
and William Bundy that Lansdale be
sent to Saigon, he did not get
there until late 1965.)

H-21Cs, 400 men) arrived in Vietnam,
the first direct U.S. military sup-
port for the GVN.
