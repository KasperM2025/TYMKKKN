The French National Assembly ratified on 4 June 1954 two treaties, one
providing for independence for Vietnam, the other for Vietnam's associ-~
ation as an equal with France in the French Union. The latter per-
mitted Vietnam to determine subsequently the extent of association.

The former recognized Vietnam "as a fully independent and sovereign
State invested with all the competence recognized by international law."
Vietnam agreed to assume France's part -"in all the rights and obliga-
tions resulting from international treaties or conventions contracted
by France on behalf or on account of the State of Vietnam or of any
other treaties or conventions concluded by France on behalf of French
Indochina insofar as those acts concern Vietnam." U.S. Department of
