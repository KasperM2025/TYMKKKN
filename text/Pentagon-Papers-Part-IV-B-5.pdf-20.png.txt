DESCRIPTION i s

At the now daily NSC meetings in™
Washington, the State Department
participants generally favor going
ahead with the coup, while the Defense
Department, both civilian and military,
prefers another try with Diem.

Harkins goes on record with doubts
about the line-up of forces for the
coup and sees no reason for our "rush
approval.”

Concerned by the differing views of
Lodge and Harkins, as well. as the
division of opinion in Washington,

the President asks the Ambassador

and MACV for their separate appraisals.

At this meeting, arranged by Minh,

he asks for clear evidence that the
U.S. will not betray them to Nhu.

He is unwilling to discuss the details
of his plan. When asked what would
constitute a sign of U.S. support,

he replies that the U.S. should sus-
pend economic aid to the regime.

Lodge replies to the Presidential query
that the U.S. is irrevocably committed
to the generals. He recommends show-
ing the CAS messages to them to establish
our good faith and if that is insuffi-
cient, he recommends a suspension of
economic aid as they requested.

Harkins reply to Taylor suggests that
one last effort be made with Diem in
the form of an ultimatum demanding
Nhu’s removal. Such a move he feels
will strengthen the hand of the generals,
not imperil them.

Another inconclusive meeting is held
with the division of opinion on a
U.S. course of action still strong,
The result is to leave policy making
in Lodge's hands.

Lodge is authorized to have Harkins
show the CAS messages to the generals
