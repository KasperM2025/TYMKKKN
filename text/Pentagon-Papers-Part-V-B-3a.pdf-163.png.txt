ll. Such an effort by France and Vietnam coupled +
with the political is3neuver already outlined might lead
the Government of Communist China to reflect whether

the policy of supporting the Vietminh is still justified,
and whether it would not be, in the last analysis,

more costly to her than the abandoment of an ally who

is unreliable except for a common Communist ideology.

12. The French Government is fully aware that

the foregoing observations are of necessity still
indefinite and represent only a first attempt to find
the best method of hastening the re-establishment of
peace not only in Korea but also in the Far East as

a whole. The intention of the French Government has
been only to indicate the direction in which it

believes that an effort should be made, in a spirit

of equity justified by a war of seven years duration,
the essential purpose of which is the defense of freedom
as well as the protection of all of Southeast Asia. The
French Government would be happy to obtain the views

on this question

of the Government of the United States

and the Government of the United Kingdom
