the relatively small but numerous successes in the field against

the VC and the encouraging progress of the Quat government,

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in all probability,
the primary objective of the GVN and the USG of changing the will â€”
of the DRV to support the VC insurgency cannot be attained in an
acceptable time frame by the methods presently employed. The air
campaign in the North must be supplemented by signal successes
against the VC in the South before we can hope to create that frame
of mind in Hanoi which will lead to the decisions we seek,

The JCS have reviewed the military resources which will be
available in SVN by the end of 1965 and have concluded that even
with an attainment of the highest feasible mobilization goals,
ARVN will have insufficient forces to carry out the kind of suc-
cessful campaign against the VC which is considered essential for
the purposes discussed above. If the ground war is not to drag
into 1966 and even beyond, they consider it necessary to rein-
force GVN ground forces with about twenty battalion equivalents
in addition to the forces now being recruited in SVN. Since these
reinforcements cannot be raised by the GVN they must inevitably
come from third country sources,

The USG accepts the validity of this reasoning of the JCS and
offers its assistance to the GVN to raise these additional forces
for the purpose of bringing the VC insurgency to an end in the
shortest possible time, We are prepared to bring in additional
U.S. ground forces provided we can get a reasonable degree of
participation from other third countries. If the GVN will make
urgent representations to them, we believe it will be entirely
possible to obtain the following contributions: Korea, one
regimental combat team; Australia, one Infantry battalion; New
Zealand, one battery and one company of tanks; Philippine Islands,
one battalion. If the forces of the foregoing magnitude are
forthcoming, the USG is prepared to provide the remainder of the
combat reinforcements as well as the necessary logistic personnel
to support the third country contingents, Also, it will use its
good offices as desired in assisting the GVN approach to these
governments,

You (the Ambassador), will seek the concurrence of the GVN
to the foregoing program, recognizing that a large number of
questions such as command relationships, concepts of employment
and disposition of forces must be worked out subsequently,

The message concluded that, armed with an instruction of this kind,
he, Taylor, would be adequately equipped to initiate what might be a
