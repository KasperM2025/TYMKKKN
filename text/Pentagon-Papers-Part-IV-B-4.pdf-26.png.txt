the preponderance of the increase occurring in FY 64. 10/ Most of

this difference was accounted for by additional Packing-Crating-Handling-
Transportation (PCHT) costs associated with the CPSVN but not accommodated
in the DOD guideline figures.

The body of the CPSVN laid out the costs in relation to the DOD
dollar guidelines, as follows:

The rationale offered was that, in order to prosecute the counter-insurgency

to a successful conclusion, while at the same time building up GVN capability
to allow early withdrawal of U.S. forces, the major costs of the program had

to be compressed into the Fy 63-65 time frame, with a particular increase in

FY 64 and another following U.S. withdrawal in FY 67. 11/ But clearly most

of the greater cost throughout the period reflected PCH.

The pattern of force levels for all South Vietnamese forces that the

CPSVN provided for, including the separate non-MAP funded Civilian Irregu-
lar Defense Group, is shown in Figure 1.
