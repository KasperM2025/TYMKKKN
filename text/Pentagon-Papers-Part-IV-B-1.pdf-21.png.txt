DESCRIPEION

Special Forces, militia teachers,
etc." would be needed to support a
"counter-guerrilla war in Vietnam."
Rostow does not mention combat
units.

Here, in response to Vice President
Johnson's request that he outline
military needs, Diem did request US
troops explicitly for training RVI
“officers and technical specialists"
-- not entire divisions. He pro-
posed ARVN be increased from ]'70,000
to 270,000 to "counter the ominous
threat of communist domination” --

a threat he documented by inflated
infiltration figures and words about
the "perilous" situation created by
the Laos solution. To train these
100,000 new ARVN troops Diem asked
for "considerable expansion” of the
MAAG in the form of "selected
elements of the American Armed
Forces."

A team headed by Eugene Staley
(Stanford Research Institute) was

to work with Vietnamese officials
in an effort to resolve the continu-
ing problem of how Vietnam was to
finance its own war effort (deficit
financing, inflation, the commodity
import program, piaster/dollar
exchange rates, all presented diffi-
culties). But the Staley group
became the vehicle for force level

’ discussions and economic issues were

treated rether perfunctorily. ‘The
group "does not consider itself com-
petent to make specific recommenda-
tions as to desired force levels" but
adopted two alternative levels for
“economic planning purposes”:
200,000 if the insurgency in Vietnam
remains at present levels, if Laos
does not fall; 270,000 if the Viet-
cong significantly increase the in-
surgency and if the communists win
de facto control of Laos.
