Strategic Considerations

29. The potential power of Asia 1s strategically significant

both to the United States and to the USSR because of its capacity in

the Long run to affect the relative military strength of these two

countries and hence the sharacter of iliteny operations in the event
of war between them. Translation of the Asian â€˜power potential into
military strength would require development of each of its elements--
organization and training of manpower, exploitation of natural re-
sources, development of sea transportation, improvement of communica-
tions and further industrialization--as well as their integration to-
ward coordinated Sbiestives. Even given the most favorable atmos-

phere for development, including the power to consolidate as neces-

_ sary, the authority to divert channels of trade, and the military

Once required to protect long sea routes and other lines of commnuni-

cation--the full development of Asia's potential power is a long-term
affair. In the power potential of Asia, Japan plays the most import-
ant part by reason of its industrious, aggressive population, provid-
ing a large pool of trained manpower, its integrated internal communi-
cations system with a demonstrated potential for an efficient mer-
chant marine, its already developed industrial base and its strategic
position. Because of Japan's economic importance in Asia, of the ex-
treme vulnerability of Japan to blockede, of the long period required
uncer the best of circumstances for the development of significant
strategic potential in Asia, and of the hazards involved in attempts
to harness Chinese potential to Soviet ends, there exists no serious

danger that the USSR will in the near future be able to undertake mil-

itary aggression pased on Asia's strategic potential.
