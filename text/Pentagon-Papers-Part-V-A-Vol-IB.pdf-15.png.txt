"The violent battles now being waged in Viet-Nem and the armed
aggressions egainst Laos and Cambodia are not creating any spirit of
defeatism. On the contrary, they are rousing the free nations to measures
which we hope will be sufficiently timely and vigorous to preserve these
vital areas from Commimist domination.

"Tn this course lies the best hope of achieving at Geneva the
restoration of peace with freedom and justice."
