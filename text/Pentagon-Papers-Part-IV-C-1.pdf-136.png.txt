In addition to the above the Johnson report suggested two alternative
deployments of a tailored division force to assist Vietnamese units in of-
fensive action in II Corps. One was to deploy U.S. combat units toâ€™ assume
responsibility for security of the Bien Hoa~Tan Son Nhut air base complex,
Nha Trang, Qui Nhon and Pleiku, The second was to deploy U.S. combat units
to assume responsibility for defense of Kontum, Pleiku and Darlac provinces
in II Corps. On the first alternative the Secretary noted: "Johnson does
not recommend this;" he suggested that JCS should study, and "Max's and
Westy's views" toward the second alternative should be sought. 139/

Not only was RVNAF strength considerably below the goals set and agreed
upon, it was in considerable danger of actually decreasing. The situation
on this score was indicated by the following table included in the March
MACV report. 140/
