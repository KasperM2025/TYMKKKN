During the questioning period which followed the President's presentation,
the following dialogue between the President and one of his interlocutors
is recorded:

"Question: Mr. President, does the fact that you are sending
additional forces to Vietnam imply any change in the existing
policy of relying mainly on the South Vietnamese to carry out
offensive operations end using American forces to guard installa-
tions and to act as emergency backup?

"The President: It does not imply any change in policy what-
ever. It does not imply change of objective."

The Annex to JCSM 590-65, forwarded by the JCS on 30 July 1965, Â°
reflected the final Phase I package approved for deployment as 4 maneuver
battalions and a total strength in South Vietnam after all units had closed
of 193,887 U.S. fighting men. During ensuing discussions concerning
Phase II of the build-up, the Phase I package was further refined and in-
creased. By 10 November, the Phase I package was fixed at 219,000 U.S.
personnel. 167/

The build-up progressed apace while the debate continued. In July
two more Army brigades arrived followed closely by a corps headquarters.
The 2d Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, which had originally been scheduled
to protect Qui Nhon, went to Bien Hoa, leaving one battalion at Cam Ranh
Bay for security. 168/ That battalion rejoined its parent unit when
relieved at Cam Ranh by the lst Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. In
August the landing of the 7th Marine Regiment brought III MAF to a total
strength of one Marine Division plus one regiment or 12 BLT's. 169/ The
airmobile division, organized on 1 July as the lst Air Cavalry Division,
was fully deployed and responsible for its TAOR on 28 September. The re-
mainder of the lst Infantry Division closed on 7 October, 170/ and the ROK
forces were fully deployed by 8 November, bringing the US/3rd Country
forces in-country to a total fighting force of 4 maneuver battalions. 171
U.S. strength in South Vietnam at the end of 1965 was 184,314 men. 172
