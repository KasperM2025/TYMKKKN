DRAFT STATEMENT OF U, S. POLICY ON INDOCHINA
FOR USG CONSIDERATION

(Reference NSC 64, NSC 73/4)

1. Firm non-Communist control of Tadochins is of critical,
strategic importance to U. 8. national interests. The loss of
Indochina to Communist forces would undoubtedly lead to the loss
of Southeast Asia as stated in NSC 64. In this respect, the National
Security Council accepts the strategic assessment of Southeast Asia
which the Joint Chiefs of Staff made on 10 April 1950 (Annex No. 1.).

2. Regardless of current U. ยง. commitments for provision of
certain military assistance to Indochina, the U. S. will not commit
any of its armed forces to the defense of Indochina against overt,
foreign aggression, under present circumstances. In case of overt
aggression, the Department of Defense will immediately re-assess the
situation, in the light of the then existing circumstances.

3. To strengthen the security of Indochina against external
aggression and augmented internal Communist offensives, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff are authorized to conduct military talks with U. K.
and French military commanders in the Far Hast. Such talks would
seek, first, an agreed military plan for the internal defense of
Indochina and, second, the coordination of ie in in Southeast
Asia in the eveit of invasion. Such talks should Searly Sndioxse
to French authorities that increases in U.S. military aid will be

provided
