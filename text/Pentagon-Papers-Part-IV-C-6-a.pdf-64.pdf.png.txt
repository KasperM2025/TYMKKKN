3. The JCS Try Again

Accordingly, the JCS submitted their plan on 4} April 1966 which
provided for placing all 37 Army maneuver battalions in SVN by January
1967. 56/ â€˜The end of year strength for 1966 was projected to be 376,350,
while the strength at the end of CY 67 was to be 438,207.

Although Secretary McNamara still had questions about the dis-
crepancy between the JCS plan laid out on } April 1966 and the Case 1
capabilities, he apparently accepted the reasoning expressed by Assis-
tant Secretary of Defense Alain Enthoven in his memorandum of 9 April
1966, "that there is not much to be gained by insisting on a more rapid
deployment of maneuver battalions." 57/

4, McNamara Acquiesces

Accordingly, on 11 April 1966 Secretary McNamara, "with the
exceptions noted.../approved ...the deployment plan proposed by the
Joint Chiefs of Staff in JCSM 218-66." 58/

Attached to his approval memorandum was a set of tables entitled
"April 10 Deployment Plan." These showed planned U.S. strength at the
end of December 1966 to be 70 maneuver battalions and 383, 500 personnel.
The remaining 9 maneuver battalions would arrive in January 1967 and by
the end of June 1967 total strength was scheduled to be 425,000. This
plan, called the "10 April Plan" by Systems Analysis and the Secretary
of Defense's office represented the approved version of what the Services
called the Deployment Plan for Phase IIA(R).

Apparently however, even this was not close enough to the
original Case 1 deployment capabilities schedule to suit Secretary
MeNemara, and in a memorandum dated 12 April 1966 he asked why the
difference between the revised JCS figure for end of '66 strength and
the Case 1 figure for end '66 strength of 413,557. 59/

The Acting Chairman of the JCS answered as follows:

changes in requirements and refinements in strengths, the
