Requirements for PACOM other than Vietnam would total 23 maneuver
battalions and 271,666 personnel. The PACOM conference results clearly
amplified what General Westmoreland had echoed over a month earlier as
the manpower problem in Vietnam worsened. NVA infiltration in the DMZ
area, the strategy of hitting the enemy in his sanctuaries and the addi-
tional manpower requirements of the pacification program punctuated the
eritical conclusion of the PACOM conference; they could not justify a
reduction in requirements submitted. In the meantime, information which
the Secretary of Defense had requested on alternative force structures
possible under piaster ceilings of 42, 44, and 46 billion, had been for-
warded to the JCS. 58/ The three packages did not cost out at the
exact ceilings, because of the requirement for balanced forces, but the
alternatives were as follows:

Before the formal JCS ratification of the CINCPAC-COMUSMACYV
requirements was forwarded, one other important contact between the major
decision-makers on Program hk occurred. This was at Manila in late October.
What views were exchanged between the President and General Westmoreland
remain a mystery, but the General twice sought out Mr. John McNaughton,
Assistant Secretary of Defense, ISA, and laid out his thinking on force
levels, ROLLING THUNDER, the barrier, and Revolutionary Development. 59/

The American commander was thinking about an end CY 67 strength of
about 480,000, fleshed-out to 500,000 by the end of CY 68. Barring sur-
prises, he would plan to hold it there. This was a substantial drop from
his original request through CINCPAC, but apparently he had not yet resigned
himself to McNamara's figure of 470,000. He believed that those levels
were what "the U.S. [could/ sustain over time without mobilization and
without calling up reserves and what the Vietnamese economy /could/ bear."
He said the 480,000-500,000 man level would be enough "even if infiltration
went on at a high level," but he waffled by adding he was not sure if he
had enough troops to take on the Delta.
