3. McNamara's Recommendations to the President

Upon his return from Saigon, Secretary Mcilamara drafted a
Memorandum for the President, outlining the changed military situation
in Vietnam, and commenting that in view of the communist build-up,
“the presently contemplated Phase I forces will not be enough...Nor
will the originally contemplated Phase II addition of 28 more U.S.
battalions (112,000 men) be enough...Indeed it is estimated that, with
the contemplated Phase II addition of 28 U.S. battalions we would be
able only to hold our present geographical positions." 39/

In order to "provide what it takes in men and materiel...to stick
with our stated objectives and with the war," Secretary McNamara recom-
mended the deployment of one Korean division plus another brigade, an
additional Australian battalion, and 40 U.S. combat battalions, bringing
the total of U.S. maneuver battalions to 74, and the total of U.S. per-
sonnel in Vietnam to approximately 400,000 by the end of 1966 with the
possible need for an additional 200,000 in 1967.

In the 7 December version of his Memorandum for the President,
McNamara added the information that “although the 1966 deployments to
South Vietnam may require some shift of forces from other theaters, it
is believed that they can be accomplished without calling up reserve
personnel; however, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not believe additional
forces can be deployed to Southeast Asia or elsewhere unless reserves
are called." ho

In evaluating this course of action, the Secretary warned that it
"will not guarantee success." He estimated the odds to be about even
that the NVA/VC will match the U.S. buildup and that "even with the
recommended deployments, we will be faced in early 1967 with a military
standoff at a much higher level, with pacification still stalled, and
with any prospect of military success marred by the chance of an active
Chinese intervention."

4. Phases I, II, and ITA Are Published

On 13 December, the Secretary of Defense sent out a Draft
Memorandum for the President, which included tables outlining the
planned deployments to Southeast Asia under Phases I, II and IIA.
This December Plan projected the total strength for Phases I, II and
IIA to be 367,800 by the end of 1966 and 393,900 by the end of June
1967. The number of U.S. maneuver battalions would reach 75 by the
end of 1966.

Meanwhile, the requirements which Secretary McNamara had browse
back from Saigon with him were being reviewed by CINCPAC in preparation
for a planning conference scheduled for 17 January to 6 February 1966.
at which the refined requirements would be presented and recommended
deployment schedules prepared.
