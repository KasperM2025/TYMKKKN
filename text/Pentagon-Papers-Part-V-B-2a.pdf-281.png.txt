30. The location of Asia, contiguous to the USSR and separated
from the United States, presents different strategic implications,
both offensive and defensive, to the United States and to the USSR.
The Asian power potential is more valuable to Russia than to the
United States, since American induatrial power is so much greater
than Russian, The industrial plant of Japan would be the richest
strategic prize in the Far East for the USSR. For Japan and major
Asian raw-material producing areas, together with the necessary
trensportation lines, to be controlled by the Soviet Union would add
measurably to the war-making potential of the USSR. Russia could
not, however, quickly build up a powerful self-sufficient war-making
complex in Asia without access to and control over Saves and could
not effectively mobilize Japan in war without a larger merchant
fleet in the Pacific than the USSR and Japan are likely to have for
years to come. Other Asiatic assets of potential value to Russia
| include soybeans, tin, rubber, and,South China's tungsten, Petro-
oun, cor” ng from Indonesia including Borneo, while not essential to
meet Russian domestic requirements, is one of the most important
“strategic materials in the region.

31. The strategic value of Asia to the United States rests on
three considerations: In the first place denial. of USSR eontHol over
Asia might prevent the acquisition by the Soviets of elements of
power which might in time add significantly to the Russian war-making
potential. Secondly, to the degree that Asian indigenous forces de-
velop opposition to the expansion of USSR influence, theywould assist

the U. S. in containing Soviet control and influence in the area,
