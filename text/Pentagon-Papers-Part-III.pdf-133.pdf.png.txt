Dulles to American Embassy, Paris, Tel No. 77, 7 Jwly 1954 (SECRET)
In its Progress Report of 6 August, OCB said there was need for
"nolitical action" to build a strong foundation in free Asia for
the continued orientation of the countries there toward the Free
World. "A test of such political action and orientation will be
the elections in Laos and Cambodia during 1955, and in North and
South Vietnam during 1956."

This objective, stated in NSC 5429/1, was approved by the President.
