President Johnson decided to
send two more Marine battalions
to Da Nang and Fhu Bai and to
alter the mission of U.S. com-

‘bat forces "to permit their

more active use” under condi-
tions to be established by the
Secy of State in consultation
with SecDef. He also approved
18 to 20,000 man increase in U.S.
forces to fill out existing
units and provide needed logis-
tic personnel. (All of these
changes were to be contingent

on GVN concurrence.) A slowly
ascending tempo in response to
rises in enemy rates of activity
was approved for the Rolling
Thunder program. The President
agreed to overtures to GOA, GNZ,
and to ROK, seeking combat sup-
port from them.

McCone said present level of RT
not hurting DRV enough to make
them quit. He warned against
putting more U.S. troops into
SVN for combat operations,
since that would merely en-
courage the USSR and China

to support the DRV/VC at
minimum risk. He predicted
covert infiltration of PAV
and the U.S. getting mired
down in a war it could not win.

JCS asked SecDef to clear the
decks of "all administrative
impediments that hamper us in
the prosecution of this war."
Specifically, they asked for:
increases in funds, a separate
MAP for SEA, improved communica-
tions systems, quicker response
to CINCPAC's requests, exemption

_of SEA from balance of payments

goals, authority to extend mili-
tary terms of service and to
consult with Congress on the use

of Reserves, relaxation of civilian
