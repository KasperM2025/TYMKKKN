may therefore expect prior notice, We had hoped to be propared to pre-
sent moro specific US views on the nature and extent of retaliatory
action against Communist China following an identifiable aggression in
Southeast Asia and other related subjects to the British by this timo
but have not yet been able to do so, We are finding it difficult to
reconcile the proposed diplomatic and military courses of action, Pro-
gress is being made and it is hoped that something will be ready in the
near future."" (Note: Here the Secretary apparently had NSC 124 in
mind although he made no direct reference to it,)

The Secretary confirmed to the Ambassador that these were our main
points,

The Ambassador refdrred to the increasing concern in London with |
Southeast Asia, H,.M.G, is concerned not only with the present precarious |
situation in the area, a concern which has been greatly accentuated in |
recent weeks by their suspicions of French intentions in Indochina, but
also with the snowballing effects of any action which might follow a \
further Chinese aggression, The question of Korea is of course related
to their concern, 4

The Ambassador then noted that the last Ad Hoc Military Comitteots
findings were a failure in that they resulted only in the presentation
of three parallel sets of views which never met, The time is now
fitting, in the opinion of H.M.G., to make a serious effort to reconcile
US and UX views, It is therefore requested that we give urgent thought
to the following proposal, <A politico-military conference be held as
soon as possible in which a limited number of British and American
military and Foreign Office officials should take part, He spoke of
hinself, Mc. Matthews, General Bradley and Marshal Elliot; In answer
to the Secretary's question he replied that he did not propose that the
Joint Chiefs or any other group bo brought from London in order to
- participate, Hea belioves that the conversations should be concerned
with the hypothesis that the Chinese Communists would commit an overt
aggression in Indochina, that we were resolved to oppose that aggression
and that our objective was to combat the aggression itself and not
necessarily to overthrow the Chinese Peoples Republic, On that basis
we would concern ourselves with the following two considerations: (a)
the kind of retallatory action which wo are able to take and its expected
effectiveness, and {b) an assossmeht of what would be the results of the
' retaliatory action in bringing the Sino-Soviet pact into operation,

The Anbassador stated that H.M.G. believos that any Chinese ageresâ€”
sion could be countered not only where it takes place but also, to a
limited degree, at the base of the enemy's operations in China without-
bringing the Sino-Soviet pact into operation, The question to be
determined, however, arises out of the difference of opinion between the
UK and the US as to where that limit is to be found,
