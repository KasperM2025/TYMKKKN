the principle that U.S. should not contravene the settlement. Dept
of State telegram 3441 from Saigon of 17 February 1955 discloses
Ambassador Collins' concern for observing the agreements even when
observance precluded U.S. assistance for refugees.

Anita Lauve Nutt, Troika on Trial, op. cit., 315-328. Though ques-
tionable on some judgments -- e.g., attributing to the "civilian
branch of the U.S. Government‚Äù a view that was in opposition to that
of "military authorities" and against U.S. assumption of RVNAF train-
ing, Mrs. Nutt is essentially correct in her assertion that the U.S.
abided by the Geneva ceilings for six years. The principal departure
from the 342 strength accommodated TERM, a 350-man Temporary Equip-
ment Recovery Mission which from May 1956 to December 1960 worked to
recover, control and outship MDAP supplies -- albeit upgrading the
RVNAF logistic capability significantly in the process. The first
substantial increase in MAAG followed a February, 1960, GVN request,
which raised the ceiling from 342 to 685 -- still below the figure
of 888, the combined 1954 strength of French cadres with RVNAF and
MAAGs.
