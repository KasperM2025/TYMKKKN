State Dept. memo to the
President i

Backing away from his 1 July
views, McNamara recommended
mining the harbors only as a
"severe reprisal." Sorties
should be raised to 4,000.
Political improvement a must
in SVN; low-key diplomacy to
lay the groundwork for a
settlement.

Future bombing policy should
emphasize the threat, minimize
DRV loss of face, optimize
interdiction over political
costs, be coordinated with
other pressures on the DRV, and
avoid undue risks of escalation.

McNamara justifies the Adminis-
tration's bombing restraint,
pointing to the risk of escala-
tion in attacks on POL, air-
fields or Hanoi-Haiphong areas.

The JCS recommend air strikes
against "lucrative" NVN targets
-- POL, power plants, etc.

JCSM 670 is rejected as a
dangerous escalatory step.

Thompson, discussing the possi-
bility of a pause, notes need
to tell Hanoi we'd resume if
the effort failed.

McNamara urges the approval

of the bombing "pause" he had
first suggested in his 20 Jul
memo to test NVN's intentions.

A State memo to the President,
written by U. Alexis Johnson
with Rusk's endorsement, opposes
a pause at a time when Hanoi has
given no sign of willingness to
talk. It would waste an impor-
tant card and give them a chance
to blackmail us about resumption.
