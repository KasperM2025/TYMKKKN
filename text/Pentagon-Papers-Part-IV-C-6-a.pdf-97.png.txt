Conflicting Inexorables

1. Lodge's Piaster Ceiling

On 1 October 1966, Ambassador Lodge sent back his reply to

the State Department's earlier message. 43/

A. SUMMARY
1. REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN MISSION COUNCIL CONCURRENCE
ON PIASTER BUDGETS FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR OF 1967 HAVE NOT
PROVEN SUCCESSFUL, AFTER CONSIDERASLE STUDY OF THIS _
ENTIRE MATTER, I, NEVERTHELESS, PROPOSE THAT WASHINGTON ACCEPT
A U.S, PIASTER EXPENDITURE CEILING FOR 1967 OF 42 BILLION FOR THE
U.S. MILITARY AND 16 FOR THE U.S, CIVILIAN ELEMENTS. THIS
TOTAL OF 58 BILLION FOR 1967 COMPARES WITH 42 BILLION IN 1966,
THESE SPENDING LEVELS, WHEN OFFSET BY ANTI~ INFLATIONARY
MEASURES, GIVE AN ESTIMATED SO-CALLED "INFLATIONARY GAP" OF 10
BILLION PIASTERS FOR 1867. IN MY JUDGYENT, as ES
PIASTER SPENDING LEVELS YOULD CAUSE AN ACCELERATION OF
aie ce eee OUR POLITICAL AND MILITARY
PROGRESS,

2. DURING THE USAID PRESENTATION TO THE MISSION COUNCIL OF
ITS 1967 PROGRA: IT BECAME APPARENT THAT A DECISION ON THE
USAID PROGRAM COULD BE MADE ONLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH A REVIEW
OF ALL U.S, AGENCY PROXGRAMS IN TERMS OF THEIR PIASTER AND
MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS, I REQUESTED A REVIEW OF PLANNED
PROGRAMS AND SPENDING LEVELS OF U.S. AGENCIES AND RECEIVED
REQUESTS TOTALLING 75 RILLIOW PIAGTERS (REF. A, OF WHICH ABOUT
KQ BILLION PIASTERS WERE Us ani AFD 26 BILLION FOR
U.S. CIVILIAN PURPOSES, IHIS COMPARES TO A TOTAL U.S, PIASTER
SPENDING THIS YEAR OF ABOUT 42 BILLION PIASTERS, OF WHICH THE
MILITARY CONSTPTUTES 32 AND THE CIVII TAN 12. THE INCREASE
REQUESTED BY THE MILITARY OF 19/BILLION 1S OBVIOUSLY ct OSELY
RELATED TO THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN TGOOP STRENGTH WHICH LATEST
REPORTS AVAILABLE TO ME SHOW LILLIGO FROM ABOUT 386,929 BY
THE END OF 1866 TO ABOUT 519,09 OR SO BY THE END OF 1967.
THE INCREASE REQUESTED BY THE CIVILIAN SECTOR OF 14 BILLION

TO FINANCE THE SHARPLY EXPANDING OF "THE OTHER WARâ€™
erties oc es BUDGET LEVELS LOULD REQUIRE

AN INCREASE OF 33 BILLION PIASTERS, WHICH WHEN PLACED ON TOP OF
AN ALREADY TAUT ECONOMY YOULD CERTAINLY CAUSESERIOUS INFLATION,

THE QUESTPON IS NOT HOW MUCH WE MUST CLT, BUT WHERE,
