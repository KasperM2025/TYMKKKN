“government to adopt them. let/ Available evidence indicates that the standard
ARVN division of 1959 was pauterned after the 1956 U.S. Army division--
reduced in scale, and without organic armor, aviation, end band.

Each ARVN standard division had 10,450 men organized in three
regiments, each of which was capable of independent action and could be
broken into company-Size task forces. Each division had two artillery
battalions equipped with towed 105 mm howitzers and 4,2" mortars, one
engineer battalion, and technical and logistics support companies. The
seven divisions were formed into two Corps. There were also four armor
battalions, one airborne brigade, one marine group, one air force fighter-
bomber squadron, two C-47 transport squadrons, two light aircraft observa-
tion squadrons, and one squadron of helicopters. 127-/

. In 196) Lieutenant General Samuel T. Williams (Chief MAAG
Vietnam 1955-60) during the course of an interview was asked whether MAAG
had created the Vietnamese Division in the image of the American Division.
His vehement denial included the statement that "Actually, there was little
similarity between the South Vietnamese division in existence then [19597
or now /1964/." 122/ However, an examination of the following table and
figures indicates that there were more similarities than differences in the
overall structure of the two organizations. All of the technical services
were to be found in the 1959 ARVN Division, although at somewhat reduced
‘ strength in some cases. Division artillery was 50 percent heavier in the
U.S. Division and was concentrated in 105 mm howitzer battalions with some
155 mm, 8-inch and 763 mm weapons. The ARVN Division had a }.2-inch
mortar battalion in addition to the 105 mm battalion. Maneuver units,
the regiments of the U.S. and ARVN Division, were about equal in strength.
Both regiments contained a mortar company. There were more regiments in
the U.S. Division (5) as opposed to ARVN's 3, and the U.S. regiments were
divided into rifle companies (4 per regiment). In the ARVN Division there
was an intermediate battalion echelon. In this respect the 1959 ARVN
Division more closely resembled the 7-11R Regiment of the U.S. Army 7R
Division (1955). This regiment type was heavier than both the ROCID 7-117
Infantry Regiment and the ARVN 1959 Regiment and was evidently capable of
more sustained operations, since it had organic support units attached to
it including a company of tanks. A similar regiment (7-11R) without the
technical support units was supposed to provide the division with the flex-
ibility to conduct operation with task forces of any size, a stated goal
of the authors of the ARVN Divisional reorganization. 12%/ Thus, while the
mirror image accusation is not entirely correct, neither is the denial that
there were no similarities between the U.S. and ARVN Division. The evi-
dence available suggests that clearly the blueprint for the 1959 ARVN
Division reorganization was to be found in the TOE's of the U.S. Army.

5- Manpower policies in Vietnam in the late 1950's resulted in
allocation of the best personnel to the Vietnamese Armed Forces.
