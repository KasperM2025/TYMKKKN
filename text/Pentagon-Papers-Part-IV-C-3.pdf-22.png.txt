DESCRIPTION

The Presidential decisions of April 2 are
promulgated using the verbatim language
of the Bundy memo.

In a major speech et Johns Hopkins Univ-
ersity, the President outlines his hope
for a peaceful, negotiated settlement ~
in Vietnam. He names Eugene Black as the
US negotiator and offers to assist both
North and South Vietnam on a regional
basis to the tune of $1 billion in the
post-war reconstruction and economic de-
velopment of SEA.

Rejecting to the President's initiative,
the DRV Foreign Minister, Pham van Dong
announces his famous "Four Points" for

the settlement of the war. Each side

sees settlement in the caputulation of the.
other. Peking denounces the President's
speech also.

In a press conference the President ack-
nowledges the failure of his most recent
peace overtures.

Secretary Rusk rejects suggestions from
Canada and others to suspend the bombing
in order to get peace talks started. He
reiterates the President's view that
Hanoi does not want peace.

Having been bombarded with cables from
Washington about a build-up in ground
forces to carry out NSAM 328, Taylor re-
acts opposing the idea in ae cable to
McGeorge Bundy.

Hanoi rejects the proposal of the 17 non-
aligned nations for a peace conference
without pre-conditions by either side.

Secretary McNamara meets with Taylor,
Westmoreland, Sharp, Wm. Bundy, and
McNaughton in Honolulu to review the im-
plementation and interpretation of NSAM.
