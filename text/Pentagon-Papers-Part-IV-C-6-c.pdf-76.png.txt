Adding fuel to this controversy was the unexpected triumph in the
New Hampshire Presidential Primary on 12 March of the Democratic "peace"
candidate, Senator Eugene McCarthy. This triumph was widely heralded
as @ repudiation by the voters of the present Administration and its
Vietnam policies, and it encouraged another critic of these policies,
Senator Robert Kennedy, to announce on 16 March his intention to seek
the Democratic Presidential nomination.

7. The President Ponders

At a meeting at the White House on 13 March, the President
decided to deploy 30,000 troops to South Vietnam in addition to the 10,500
emergency augmentation already made. This would substantially meet
General Westmoreland's initial package request. Army forces would
replace those Marine Corps forces requested, as the Marine Corps could
not sustain the requested deployments. Also an additional Army brigade
(7,363 personnel) would be deployed to replace Marine RLT 27, and its
associated support. RLT 27 sould begin to return to CONUS on 15 July.
The forces to be deployed were as follows:
