Rec'd August 6, 1948

FROM: Paris
ube} Secretary of State
NO: 4034, August 5, 8 poem.

Bollaert is of opinion (DEPTEL 2891, July 29) that
President French Union may legally ratify Baie d'Along
agreements but that change in status Cochinchina re-
quires Assembly action. He maintains that he will not
return to Saigon unless there is an Assembly debate on
government's policy in Indochina and approval of Baie
d'Along agreements and change in status Cochinchina.

Baeyens, Delavignette and Moutet share Bollaert's views.
All consider that regardless of legal considerations,
failure by Assembly to meet issue squarely will have
practical effect of arousing such mistrust in Indochina
as to nullify completely such progress as has been made,

In last night's session of Assembly, Frederic DuPong
(PRL) introduced motion calling for discussion Indochina
prior to adjournment for summer. Despite request by
Ramadier that motion be withdrawn “as it deals with sub-
ject too delicate for government to undertake without
prudence and without a full review of all aspects of the
situation.” Motion was carried by narrow vote 288 to
286. Date of debate will be set by conference of
presidents.

Sent Department O34, repeated Saigon 36.
