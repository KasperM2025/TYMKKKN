The Chiefs, replying to
McNamara's May 20 request,
again reject all suggestions
for a cutback in the bombing.

The Secretary of the Navy con-
cluded,in reply to the May 20
request, that the cutback to

the panhandle would be marginally
more productive than the current
campaign.

Harold Brown favored the
expanded campaign against LOCs

in northern NVN in his reply

to McNamara's May 20 request.

Katzenbach favors concentrating
the bombing against LOCs through-
out the country and abandoning
attacks on "strategic" targets.

The Kep airfield comes under
attack for the lst time and
ten MiGs are destroyed.

Three bombing programs are
offered: (a) intensified
attack on Hanoi-Haiphong logis-
tical base; (b) emphasis south
of 20Â°; (c) extension of the
current program. McNamara,
Vance & Secllav favor B; JCS
favor A; SecAF favors C.

Hanoi was possibly reconsidering
the desirability of negotiations.

Bunker doubts the effectiveness
of bombing at interdiction and
therefore urges the rapid com-
pletion of the barrier.

Sharp argues that results of the
bombing in recent months demon-
strate its effectiveness and are
a powerful argument for its
expansion.
