DATE EVENT OR DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION
26 Oct 1963 Vietnamese National Diem reviews the troops in
Day the National Day parade before

secant crowds with Lodge and
all other diplomatic personnel
in attendance. The coup had
originally been scheduled for
this day.

27 Oct 1963 Lodge-Diem meeting As planned, Lodge travels to
Dalat with Diem and engages
in a day-long conversation
that produces little results.
Diem makes his standard com-
plaints against the U.S., and
whenever Lodge asks what he is
planning to do about specific
U.S. requests, he changes the
subject. At one point, he
does inquire, however, about
resumption of the commercial
import program. Lodge asks
what movement he will make on
our requests. Diem changes
the subject. Lodge's feelings
of frustration confirm his con-
viction that we cannot work
with Diem.

suicide by fire.

prior to departing for the
dedication of an atomic energy

for the U.S. lodge says yes.
Don then affirms the need for
the coup to be completely Viet-
namese. Lodge agrees, but when
he asks about timing, Don re-
plies that the generals are
not yet ready.

CAS agent meets Don That evening Conein meets Don
again and the latter says that
the plans may be available for
Lodge only four hours before
