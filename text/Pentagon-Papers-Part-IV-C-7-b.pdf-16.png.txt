The discussion section of the paper dealt with each of
the eight specific option areas noting our capability in each instance
to inflict heavy damage or complete destruction to the facilities in
question. The important conclusion in each instance was that elimination
of the targets, individually or collectively, could not sufficiently
reduce the flow of men and materiel to the South to undercut the Communist
forces fighting the war. The inescapable fact which forced this conclusion
was that North Vietnam's import potential far exceeded its requirements
and could sustain considerable contraction without impairing the war
effort. The point was dramatically made in the following table:

When Option 4 is taken together with Options 1-3, the
import and need figures appear as follows:

NORTH VIETNAM'S POTENTIAL FOR OBTAINING
IMPORTS BEFORE AND AFTHR U.S. ATTACK

bons per dey
Potential Now Potential After Attack

By sea 6,500 650
By Red River from China 1,500 150
By road from China 3,200 2,400
By vail from China 6,000 4,000
TOTAL — 17,200 7,200
Without major hardship, the need for imports is as follows (tons
per day):
Normal imports 4.200
If imports replace destroyed industrial production 1,400

If imports replace rice destroyed by leveee breaks 600-2, 500
TOTAL 6,200-8,100 35/

With respect to crippling Hanoi's will to continue the war,
‘the paper stated: :

Unless things were going very badly for them there
[in the South/, it is likely that the North Vietnamese
would decide to continue the war despite their concern over
the increasing destruction of their country, the effect of
this on their people, and their increasing apprehension
that the US would invade the North. 36/ :
