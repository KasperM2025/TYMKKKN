three new states, The Thai Govt recognized the Indochinese states on
FEB 28, Unfortunately, the US REFS accredited to the remaining Asian.
countrics have been inforned by the officials of those countrics that
they regard the GOVTS of the three states as FR puppets and that, more |
important, they are not convinced of the genuine character of FR intentions
_wltinately to accord the states of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia the full
neasuiss- of indopendence and sovercignty which have recently been transe
ferred by the NETH to INDO, Tho rosponsible ministers of the Asian
powors coneerned have stated in substance that wore the Republic of
Franco to announce publicly that the present agreentnts were the first
steps in an orderly cvolutionsry preeess, the end end purpose of which

is to accord the three states of Indochina complete independence,
sovercignty and administration of their own affairs (within tho FR Union),
those Asiatic states WID be prepared favorably to consider recognition

of the three states in Indochina oven before such additional transfers

of sovercignty WID heave actually been made, Thoerofore, while Dept
obviously unable guarantce recognition and support fol such statcrént,
Dept bolicves that in absence such statenont further acts of recognition
by Asian statcs not forthcoming, Dept keenly aware of sclf-~evident fact
that INDOS cannot administer comploxitios Indoehinese affairs without FR
assistance, Dept determined as matter of general policy to envhasizo
interdcpendenco France and Indochina as was successfully done in case
NETH and Indonesians, DEFT beliovos that independence and autonomy of
three IC states must clearly be understood to lie within FR Union,

The GOVT of the US is ayaro of the concessions granted by the
Republic of France in negotiating and ratifying tho .igroenents, The US
GOVT has indicated to the Govt of France its desire te bo of assistanco
to the three states and to the FR ADMIN in Indochina in enabling then
successfully to contain and liquidate communism in Indochina, The US
GOVT is avare of the fact that the GOVT of France shares its concern
that communism be excluded not only from Indochina but from the ontiro
SEL region, Tho oxceution of this policy requires, above all things, a
unaninity of support on the part of the nations of SEA of the anti-COMAiE
Indochineso nationalist GOVIS of Indochina,

QTE With full consclousness of the difficultics involved, the US
GOVT roquests the Govt of Franco soriously to consider the issuance at
the earliest possible moment of a public statement of the chsracter
identified in the forogoing, While it is not for the DEP! to suggest
tho particularities of the text of such a statenent, the DEF! believes
that the FR GGVSEID make cloar thorein the concessions to Indochineso
nationslisn which it mado in the MR & agroeéments, and the supplonentary
accords lest both FR accomplishments and intentions in this great matter
be tragically nisvnderstood not only in Asia but in tho Western world as
