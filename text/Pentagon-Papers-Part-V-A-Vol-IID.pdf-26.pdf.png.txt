proclaimed ambitions in this respect and what they say not only about their
neighbors in Asia but such continents as Africa -- Africa is ripe for revo-
lution, meaning to them ripe for an attempt on their part to extend their
domination into that continent -- there is a primitive, militant doctrine
of world revolution that would attempt to destroy the structure of inter-
national life as written into the United Nations Charter.

"Now, these are appetites and ambitions that grow upon feeding. In 1954
Vietnam was divided. North Vietnam became communist. The next result was
pressures against Laos, contrary to those agreements; pressures against '
South Vietnam, contrary to those agreements. In other words, until there
is a determination in Peiping to leave their neighbors alone and not to
press militantly their notions of world revolution, then we are going to
have this problem.

"And it's the same problem we have had in another part of the world in
an earlier period in this postwar period in such things as the Rerlin blockade,
the pressures against Greece. Those things had to be stopped. They were
stopped in the main.

"Now the problem is out in the Pacific. And we have a large interest
in the way these problems evolve in the Pacific, because we have allies
and we have interests out there. Southeast Asia is at the present time
the point at which this issue of militant aggression against one's neighbors
for ideological reasons is posed."
