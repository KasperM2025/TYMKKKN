DESCRIPITON

Lodge calls on the new Foreign
Minister, Pham Dang Lam, and
presents a note of U.S. recog-
nition. The new government
will.be heavily dependent on
the U.S. in all areas.

â€œIn the weekly progress report,

the mission notes the greatly
increased VC activity in the
week following the coup. The
return of coup units to the
field will reverse this trend,
it is hoped.

CINCPAC takes note that the
statistical indicators for the
war (VC attacks, weapons loss
ratio, VC defections) show
deterioration dating back to
the summer.

Its first set of demands having
been effectively preempted by
the new Minh Government, the
NLF release a new and stronger
set of demands including that
the U.S. influence be eliminated,
the fighting be halted and that
@ coalition government be estab-
lished. For the first time

the WLF statesthat reunifica-
tion of Vietnam is an objective.

The entire country team meets
with Rusk, McNamara, Taylor,
Bundy, and Bell to review the
current situation. Lodge
voices optimism about the new
government, but notes the in-
experience of the new leaders.
We should not press them too
hard. We should secondly pledge
aid to them in at least the
amounts we were giving it to
Diem. Brent notes the economic

- naivety of the generals and

indicates the need for greater
U.S. technical assistance to
