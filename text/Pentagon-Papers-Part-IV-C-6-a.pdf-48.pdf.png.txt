9. One of the most pressing needs is to improve the logis-
tics situation in RVN. Phase I logistic units are stretched out
through CY 66 and into CY 67. It was determined at the Honolulu
Conference in September that the preferred schedule for deploy-
ment of major Phase II combat units could not be met because the
essential logistics units would not be available in the time
frame required. Nevertheless, we accepted marginal logistic sup-
port in order to deploy combat units as rapidly as possible.
Therefore the logistics system in SVN cannot accept the even
greater burden represented by the required additional combat
forces without significant augmentation early in CY 66. We ap-
preciate the fact that this may require extraordinary measures.
It has been determined that the ports can accommodate the force
buildup if the critical through-put capability can be provided
in the form of added logistics units and related facilities.
MACV is prepared to specify the quantity, type and time phasing
of logistics units required to support the buildup.

10. Undoubtedly the detailed development of these added force
requirements and their integration into existing programs and
schedules will require another set of conferences. The initial
development should take place here with assistance from the PACOM
components as required. Subsequently a final conference in
Honolulu appears necessary to check requirements against avail~
ability, make adjustments and work out the detailed scheduling.

g- We estimate that our minimum course of action (a ROK
division and RCT and two US brigades as major units) will require
a total add-on strength of approximately 48,000 (23,000 ROK),
which includes 35,300 combat and combat support and 12,700 service
support. Our preferred course of action (a ROK div and RCT and a
US div and brigade as major units) will add approximately 64,500
(23,000 ROK), which includes 47,200 combat and combat support and
17,300 service support.

This assessment of the vc/PAVN buildup appears to be consistent with the
retrospective evaluation found in the intelligence community's National
Intelligence Estimate 14.3-66, published on 7 July 1966. According to
this later estimate, the infiltration for the months of September and
October 1965 totaled approximately 10,000 which was only 1,000 less than
the total for tne preceding 8 months, from January through August 1965.
The estimated rate of the buildup given in NIE 14.3-66 was one or two
infantry regiments per month which fits the earlier MACV estimate of

15 battalions per quarter.
