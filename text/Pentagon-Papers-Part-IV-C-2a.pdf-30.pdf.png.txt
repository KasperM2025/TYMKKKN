DESCRIPTION

"Operational" -- not policy --
aspects of air operations against
NVN were the main points of dis-
cussion, with attention centered
on the effect of pressures in
Laos, preparatory steps necessary
for a Laotian contingency and
probable repercussions.

Evaluating possible communist reac-
tion to pressures against NVN,

Mr. McNamara said the "best current
view" was an appropriately limited
attack-.against NVN, which would not
bring CHICOM air or NVN/CHICOM
ground forces. Westmoreland felt
there was no significant unused
capability left to the VC; Lodge
said the VC had a major capability
for terrorism, even for military
action against Saigon. Like Khanh,
Lodge also felt selective bombing
would build morale and wnity in
South Vietnam.

Results: The U.S. would seek inter-
national (beginning with U.S.-Thai
consultations) and domestic support
(through a Congressional Resolution)
for wider U.S. actions. ("Wider"
could mean committing up to seven
U.S. divisions and calling up the
reserves "...as the action unfolds.")
But actual expansion of the U.S.

role would be postponed for these
and oth√©r politico-military reasons.

The report to the President on
Honolulu was probably based on this
paper.in which Bundy recapped talks
there and called for time to "refine"
plexs and estimates, to "get at"
basic doubts about the value of
Southeast Asia and the importance

of the U.S, stake there.

Mr. McNamara discussed NVN targets,

troop movement capabilities with
the JCS (8 June); he wanted facts
