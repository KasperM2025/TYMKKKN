OCB, Studies with Respect to Possible U.S. Action Regarding Indo-
china, Tab E, "Plan for Political Warfare in Regard to Communist

China intervention in Indochina," undated, in enclosure to memorandum
from E. F. Drumright to Robert Murphy, May 24, 1954 (TOP SECRET).

This conceptualization stemmed from discussions of the NSC Planning
Board, and was part of a broader contingency study program. See
the Board's statement in an enclosure to a memorandum for Robert
Bowie (the Board's chairman), May 19, 1954 (TOP SECRET).

Memorandum from JCS to the Secretary of Defense, May 20, 1954
(TOP SECRET).

These conclusions were subsequently confirmed when, at the direction
of General Ridgway, a technical team of seven officers representing
the Engineer, Transportation, and Signal Corps went to Indochina

on a@ covert mission to determine military and military-related
resources available there in the event U.S. intervention was imple-
mented. The team spent the period May 31-June 22 in the field.
Their conclusions were, in general, that Indochina was devoid of
the logistical, geographic, and related resources necessary to

a substantial American ground effort such as Ridgway felt would

be required for a success. The group's findings are in a report
from Col. David W. Heiman, its leader, to Ridgway, July 12, 1954
(CONFIDENTIAL).

The Chiefs' conclusions were disputed, however, by Drumright
(in a memorandum to MacArthur, May 24, 1954, TOP SECRET). He
argued that if, as everyone agreed, Indochina was vital to Ameri-
can security, the U.S. should not consider more than a token
ground troop commitment to be a serious diversion of our capabili-
ties. While not arguing for a substantial troop commitment,
Drumright suggested that the U.S. plan for that eventuality rather
than count on defense with atomic weapons or non-nuclear strikes
on Chinese territory. Somehow, however, Drumright's concern about
the Chinese did not extend to the consideration that a massive
U.S. troop commitment, which he stated elsewhere in the memoran-
dum might prove necessary should token forces fail to do the

job, risked bringing on the Chinese.

tialled separate treaties of independence and association. The
treaties did not take effect, however, until June 4, when the
French National Assembly finally approved the documents.
