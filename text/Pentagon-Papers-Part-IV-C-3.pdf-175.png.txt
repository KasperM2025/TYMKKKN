into North Vietnam, on its way out of North Vietnam, in Leos or in
South Vietnam. But different amounts of effort and different political
prices may be paid depending on how and where it is done. The critical
variables in this regard are (1) the type of targets struck (e.g.,

rt facilities involving civilian casualties vs. isolated bridges),

2) type of aircraft (e.g., B-52s vs. F-105s), (3) kind of weapons
(e.g., napalm vs. ordinary bombs), (4) location of target (eee;
in Hanoi vs. Laotian border area), and (5) the accompanying
declaratory policy (e.g., unlimited vs. a defined interdiction zone) e

ad. Coordinate with other influences on the DRV. So long
as full victory in the South appears likely, the effect of the bombing
program in promoting negotiations or a settlement will probably be
small. The bombing program now and later should be designed for its
influence on the DRV at that unknown time when the DRV becomes more
optimistic about what they can achieve in a settlement acceptable to
us than about what they can achieve by continuation of the war.

ee Avoid undue risks and costs. The program should avoid
bombing which runs a high risk of escalation into war with the Soviets
or China and which is likely to appall allies and friends.
