Memorandum for the Chairman, JCS, Subject: Combat Service
Support Staffing in SVN, dated 23 May 1967, H-87175. An inter-
esting and revealing incident occurred when Mr. Heyman visited
the lst Log Command. During the standard briefing, the Com-
manding General noted that he had "just about the right number
of men to do the job now in South Vietnam." This prompted Heyman
when he walked down the hallway to the Personnel Section of the
ist Log Command to inquire how many troops they actually had
assigned. He was told 58,000. Upon his return he analyzed
Program 4 to see that 70,000 had been approved for the program.
This convinced him to recommend to McNamara that a hard look
be taken at the lst Log Command since it appeared in the view
of the Commanding General that they were doing just fine with
some 12,000 troops less than they had asked and had approved in
Program 4. (Memorandum, Subject: SEA Trip Report, Victor K.
Heyman, Director, SEA Programs Division, dated 11 May 1967.)
