There is, however, other evidence that questioning among the DRV
hierarchy concerning strategy and tactics for South Vietnam continued
throughout 1958 and into 1959. Captured reports from party headquarters
in South Vietnam betrayed doubt and indecisions among party leaders
there and reflected the absence of clear guidance from Hanoi. Moreover,
in 1958, and in 1959, the DRV did concentrate much of its resources on
agricultural and industrial improvement; extensive loans were obtained
from the Soviet Union and from the Chinese Peoples Republic, and
ambitious uplift programs were launched in both sectors. It is possible,
therefore, to accept the view that through 1958 the DRV still accorded
priority to butter over guns, as part of its base development strategy.

In the larger sense, domestic progress, "consolidation of the North,‚Äù
was fundamental to that strategy. As General Vo Nguyen Giap put it in
the Lao Dong Party journal Hoe Tap of January 1960:

"The North has become a large rear echelon of our army...
The North is the revolutionary base for the whole country."

Up until 1959, the economy of North Vietnam was scarcely providirg subsistence
for its people, let alone support for foreign military undertakings; by

that year, substantial progress in both agriculture and industry was

evident:

Due mainly, however, to industrial growth, the Gross National Product
reached a growth rate of 6% per annum in 1958, and sustained that rate
thereafter. Both 1958 and 1959 were extraordinarily good years in both
industry and agriculture. A long-range development plan launched in 1958
achieved an annual industrial expansion of 21% per year through 1960,
ehiefly in heavy industry. Foreign aid -- both Chinese and Soviet --

was readily obtained, the USSR supplanting the CPR as prime donor.
Foreign trade stepped up markedly. Compared with 1955, the DRV's foreign
commerce doubled by 1959, and nearly tripled by 1960.

By 1959, it seems likely that the DRV had elected to pursue a
"guns and butter" strategy, and obtained requisite Soviet and Chinese
aid. While pressing forward with its economic improvement programs --
which were showing definite progress -- the DRV prepared with word and
deed for large-scale intervention in South Vietnam. In May 1959, at the
Fifteenth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Lao Dong Party, a
