DESCRIPTION

The President decides that Hanoi's re-
sponse can be regarded as negative and
orders the bombing to resume on May 18.

US Asian and European allies are fore-
warned of the impending resumption of
bombing. In a separate msg. the President
authorizes the radar recce by B-52s of
potential SEA targets.

After five days of "pause" the bombing
resumes in the North.

On the evening of the resumption, the DRV
Foreign Ministry issues @ statement de-
scribing the pause as a "deceitful man-
euver" to pave the way for further US

acts of war.

Somewhat belatedly the DRV representative
in Paris, Mai Van Bo discusses the "four â€”
points" with the Quai somewhat softening |
their interpretation and indicating that
they are not necessarily preliminary con-
ditions to negotiations.

In a memo for the Secretary of State
Rostow argues that a clear-cut US victory
in SVN is possible. It requires mainly
more pressure on the North and effective
conduct of the battle in the South.

Declaring its support for the DRV, Peking
denounces the President's bombing pause

as a fraud.

The intelligence community gives a pessi-
mistic analysis of the likelihood that
Hanoi will seek a respite from the bomb-

ing through negotiation.

In a meeting in Hanoi with DRV Foreign
Minister Pham Van Dong, ICC Commissioner
Seaborn (Canzia) confirms Hanoi's rejec-
tion of current US peace initiatives.
