3- CINCPAC Planninse Conference Results

On 20 October, the CINCPAC Planning Conference was done and the
results forwarded to the JCS. 57/

There were few surprises. The concept had been changed to include
a heavier emphasis on RD, set forth in a preamble to the concept contained
in the 18 June submission. The estimate of Communist forces in South
Vietnam was 83,000 combat, 46,000 combat support, with 35,000 guerrillas.
Total strength was estimated at 144 infantry battalions, 60 of which
were North Vietnamese. The enemy addition to his force was estimated
at the monthly rate of 12,500 -- 9,500 NVA and 3,000 VC. A projection
of enemy strength for the end of 1966 was 143,000 combat and combat sup-
port, while the projections for the end of 1967 was 190,000. The courses
of action which seemed to be open to the enemy in October were:

1. To increase the level of operations to include the conduct
of simultaneous widely separated operations, utilizing
forces of up to division size.

2. To maintain the current level of operations which would
include the conduct of simultaneous widely separated multi-
battalion operations.

3. To threaten large-scale attacks in the DMZ in order to
divert large numbers of forces into the hinterland, thus
reducing forces available in populated areas to accomplish
Revolutionary Development.

4, To decrease the level of operations to include reverting
to guerrilla warfare.

CINCPAC's requirements and the services capabilities to provide them
were listed as follows:
