ICC, discredited in its attempts to cope with observance of Article
14(a) of the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities..." regarding
refugees, was further devalued as a stabilizing influence when forced
to admit that it was impotent in inspecting compliance with Articles
16, 17, 18, and 19: 80/
