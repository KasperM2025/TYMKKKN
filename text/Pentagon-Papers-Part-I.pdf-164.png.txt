Pham Van Dong (presently Premier, then Vice President) announced in
1950 that promulgation of the 1946 Constitution had been postponed
"because several of its provisions require for:their application the
cessation of the state of war," and in 1951, after Ho had openly
aligned with the Sino-Soviet powers, the Viet Minh radio explained
that "a gang of traitors" had been evolved in its formulation, and
hence a “progressive character was lacking." During the "Rectifica-
tion of Errors," in late 1956, after the peasant uprisings of that
year, the DRV set up a constitutional reform committee. In December,
1958, Ho invited the public to submit recommendations on a new draft
basic law, and the second Constitution was promulgated in 1960.
