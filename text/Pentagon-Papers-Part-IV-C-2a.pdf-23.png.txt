DESCRIPTION

Reasoning that deterioration in Laos
and SVN would make it very difficult
to win Hanoi's adherence to the
Geneva Accords and predicting de-
terioration was imminent, Rostow
implied necessary (U.S.) actions
should be taken soon.

Set up the Seaborn Mission (inter-

locuteur) to Hanoi for mid-June.

This reflects the deliberate,
cautious approach then dominant.
In talking with General Khanh (who
suggested putting SVN fully on a
war footing and wanted to tell NVN
that further interference in GYN
affairs would bring reprisals),
Lodge urged Khanh to keep cool and
asked that McNamara similarly en-
phasize.the need to avoid such
drastic measures during his 12 May
meeting with Khanh.

In addition to the Lodge suggestions,
McNamara was to tell Khanh the U.S.
did "not intend to provide military
support nor undertake the military
objective of trolling backâ€™ communist
control in NvN."

Khanh and McNamara met end apparently
discussed the issues mentioned above.

JCS criticized the final draft
scenario for omitting the immediate
actions mentioned in NSAM 288 (border
control and retaliatory operations);
advocated incorporating retaliatory
and overt military pressures against
NVN in the second stage, as well as
battalion-size border control opera-
tions in Laos to include striking
brides and armed route reconnaissance.
These were justified in JCS eyes
because military operations against
the DRV to help stabilize either the
Laos or SYN situation involved
