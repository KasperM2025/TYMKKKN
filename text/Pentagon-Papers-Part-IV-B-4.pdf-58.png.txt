the President gave it final approval, though that action was not included
in the NSAM issued the next day. 67/

As eventually refined, the total force increment actually came to
over 4900 U.S. personnel. In addition, other requirements not directly
related to the advisory effort itself were being generated and met inde-
pendently. By the close of 196) the year-end U.S. in-country strength
figure had climbed to approximately 23,000 personnel and further authorized
deployments were under way or in preparation.

The actual effect of "phased withdrawals" was minimal. Though 1,000
spaces among the personnel authorized MACV were eliminated in 1963, add-ons
overtook cut-backs. As an example, U.S. Army strength in Vietnam--the bulk
of the advisory effort--was allocated as follows:

number of troops, and what appeared to be a withdrawal of the United
States from the area, then this attack comes, which would put us
firmly in the area, or at least change our mind. The whole thing,
to me, is completely, at least, not understanding.

SECRETARY McNAMARA: "The period, December 1961, through the
summer of 1963 was a period of great progress within South Vietnam,
in countering the effort of the Viet Cong to overthrow that govern-
ment. However, starting in May, 1963, you will recall, a series
