TOP SECRET - Sensitive

The U. S. urges the French to come forward with a program
which can sensibly be sold to Congress as holding promise

of a satisfactory outcome, "perhaps in a couple of years."
Dulles ind*cates that the President would favor as much

as $525 million and possibly more this year if Congress

could be told "this program has enough chance of success
..../that/ it will largely clear up the situation."
Bi-Partite US-French Conversations, 22 April 1953.....0cseeee

The JCS at a meeting with State informally indicates
reservations on the feasibility of the French plan. The

JCS feel that the French must appoint an "aggressive

French military leader" to Indochina, revise the strategy
toward more offensive action, and use Vietnamese forces

in large rather than small units -- otherwise "U.S. aid
would be wasted" in Indochina. State TOSEC 9 to Paris,

BU Ape, VIG Seu /acorcw visio sim a.e-0 ls os sialsisleisls mins weal Gor oein eisweeeees

The U. S. position is clearly that "armies released in
Korea" will not strike elsewhere. Since the Indochina

war does not have the “status of an international war,"

the U, S. suggests that perhaps the French should bring

the current Laos problem before the Security Council.

Extract of Tripartite US-UK-French Meeting, 25 April 1953....

Frence is told that the U. S. proposes to recommend an

FY 1954 Mutual Security Program (MSP) for France of

$100 million for equipment of French units in SACEUR,

$460 million in funds as 40% of Indochina war expendi-

ture rate, and an additional unspecified amount involv-

ing trained Associated States forces. Memorandum on Aid,
Paris 5673 to Secretary of State, 26 April 1953..+++serseeeee

The French are reluctant to bring the Laos aggression

before the Security Council because it "might precipitate

& colonial debate.” Dulles Memorandin of Conversation,

The French request for C-119 aircraft reaches Hisenhower

and raises the question of sending U. 5. personnel on con-
bat missions in Indochina. Such a decision is seen as
having "repercussions" and raising many problems.

Douglas MacArthur, II, memorandum, 27 April 1953...0.sssseeee

The JCS approves the loan of six C-119 aircraft to the
French for use in Indochina provided they are flown by
civilian pilots. The CIA is to complete the transactions.
