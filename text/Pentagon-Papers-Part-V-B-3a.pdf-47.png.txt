260. In probable developments before July 1956, North
Vietnam (DRV), though confronted by serious economic
problems, will consolidate its control north of the
17th parailel. The DRV army has increased in strength
but will probably not attack Laos before mid-1956.
Tactics are likely to include activation of guerrille
units in South Vietnam end their reinforcement by
infiltration from the North. NIE 63.1-55, 19 July 1955..... 993

261. â€˜ihe consequences of selected U.S. courses of action
are estimated in the event of Viet Minh aggression
against South Vietnam. While overt aggression is
unlikely, U.S. efforts at undertaking other steps
to convince the Viet Minh that aggression will be
met with intervention are expected to render overt
aggression even less likely. Failure to intervene

s however, could signel an expanded Communist Chinese

effort in Asia. SNIE 63.1-4-55, 13 September 1955.......... 297
