DESCRIPTION

would convince Hanoi that they

were facing a determined foe
and that they should get out
of South Vietnam and Lacs.

Positive assessment of the
impact of the reprisal actions
was given and a continuation
of strikes against the North
was recommended.

In opposing both a new 1h-
nation Geneva. Conference on
Southeast Asia, and U.S. air
operations against the North,
State stressed the shakiness
of the GVN and the need to
shore it up internally before
any such actions were started.
For planning purposes, the
message suggested that Ambassa-
dor Taylor's suggested date
of January 1, 1965, be used
for any sustained U.S. air
campaign against the North.

U.S. forces were authorized
to attack any vessels or air-
eraft that attack or give
positive indication of intent
to attack, and to pursue such
attackers into territorial
waters or air space of all
Southeast Asian countries,
including North Vietnam.

MACV requested authority to
begin the Phase I of the covert
cross-border operations into
Taos and North Vietnam.

The positive impact of the
reprisals on South Vietnamese
morale is noted, and a strong
argument made for continuing
actions against the North to
make clear to Hanoi and Peking
the cost of their aggression.
