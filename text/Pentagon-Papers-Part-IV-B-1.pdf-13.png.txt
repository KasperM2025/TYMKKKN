A Lansdale Report on
Vietnam

Durbrow Negotiations
with Diem on the CIP

The CIP assumed the GVN had the
potential to cope with*the VC if
necessary corrective measures were
taken and if adequate forces were
provided. The implicit bargain of
the plan: the U.S. would support
â€œedequate forces" if Diem would
institute "necessary corrective
measures." Again, although socio-
political reforms were sought
through the CIP and other plans,
they were not realized during the
early Kennedy years.

Major General. G. Lansdale called
for strong support for Diem and
reconmended the U.S. demonstrate
that support immediately. Only if
Diem's confidence in the U.S. were
restored would U.S. influence be
effective, said Lansdale. He recom-~
mended the immediate transfer of
Durbrow (he was "too close to the
forest" and was not trusted by the
GVN) and immediate adoption of social,
economic, political and military pro-
grams to prove U.S. backing for Dien
as well as help Diem stabilize the
countryside.

Diem stalled the implementation of
his "major promises" (to establish

a central intelligence organization,
put operational control for counter-
insurgency operations under the mili-
tary command system, reform the cabi-
net and governmental administration).
Washington held up the "green light"
on aid as long as Diem stalled --
although the JCS and MAAG in Saigon
were impatient to get on with the war
and were annoyed by the delay.
Finally, in mid-May (after Durbrow
had ended his four-year tour in Viet-
nem) Diem implemented some "major
promises" by decree. But nothing
changed,
