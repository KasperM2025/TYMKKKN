Figure arbitrary since attribution has not yet
taken place: figure based upon 1952 experience,
and also includes counterpart of $60 million
provided out of fiscal 1953 appropriation, under
April memorandum,

Available from unprogrammed portion of carry-over
into fiscal 195% of unobligated fiscal 1953
appropriations for Far East military aid.

Arbitrarily reduced 20 percent to reflect
proportionate reduction in European military aid
appropriation below figures proposed to Congress,

This figure shown as zero because of reprogramn-
ing which took place in course of the year,
because of over~programming for France for

the period FY 1950-1953; in effect, no net
additional funds were therefore necessary for
the French end-item program out of the 1953
appropris tions.
