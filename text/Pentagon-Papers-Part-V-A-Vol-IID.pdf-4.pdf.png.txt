viewed. Although conclusions are based primarily on the state-
ments of the President, the Secretary of State and the Secretary
of Defense, the statements of other high-ranking government
officials were also.studied in ascertaining the policy context

Johnson period. The statements are organized chronologically
and are summarized for each year.
