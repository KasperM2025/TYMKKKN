DESCRIPRION

After ten days of political turmoil
and demonstrations, Khanh withdraws
the constitution, the MRC names Khanh,
Minh and Khiem to rule provisionally

and disbands itself.

Khanh returns from Dalat and ends the
crisis by resuming the Premiership.

Taylor cables an assessment that

"...at best the emerging governmental
structure might be capable of maintain-
ing a holding operation against the

Viet Cong."

Taylor meets with the President and
the NSC Principals and decisions are
made to resume Di SOTO operations,
resume 34A operations, and prepare
for further tit-for-tat reprisals.

The { September decisions are promnul-

gated.

General Phat launches a coup but it
is defeated by forces loyal to Khanh.
This establishes the power of younger
officers such as Ky and Thi.

The first resumed DE SOTO patrol comes

under apparent attack.

To avoid future

incidents, the President suspends the

patrols.

The MRC names a High National Council
of distinguished citizens to prepare

a constitution.

The MRC presents the new constitution
drafted by the High National Council.
A prompt return to civilian government

is promised.

Tran Van Huong, a civilian, is named
Premier after the appointment of Phan

Khac Suu as Chief of State, thus return-

ing the government to civilian control.
