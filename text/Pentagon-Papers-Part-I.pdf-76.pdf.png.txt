15. Leahy, I Was There, op. cit., pp. 338-339. On the basis of
research into the Air Force archives, Bernard Fall wrote in
Street Without Joy (Harrisburg, Pa.: Stackpole, 1967, 4th ed.)
note, p. 25, that General Claire Chennault, commander of the
sth Air Force, "...Did indeed fly support missions in behalf of
the retreating French forces." /After the Japanese take-over in
March./ In his The Two Viet-Nems, moreover, Fall cited the memoirs
of General Lionel-Max Chassin, commander of the French Far Fast Air
Force, to the effect that the 14th Air Force provided supplies and
even fighter support to the French until at least April 26, 1945.
(New York: Praeger, 1967, 2nd revised ed.) n. 10, pp. 468-69. In
both books, however, Fall presents a strong case for the paucity
of U.S. aid to the French in the 1945-1946 period. See also U.S.
Department of State, Memorandum of Conversation by Assistant Secre-
tary of State Dunn, 19 March 1945, and telegram to Paris 1576 of

of European Affairs (Matthews) to the State-War-Navy Coordinating
Committee, May 23, 1945. The proposal for a division of respon-
sibility between Chinese Nationalist and British forces was first

the precise dividing line, the British accepted the 16th parallel;
Truman and Churchill formally agreed to the arrangement on July 2).
