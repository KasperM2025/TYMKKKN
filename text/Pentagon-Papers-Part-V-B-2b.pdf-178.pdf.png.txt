to continue” its efforts to resist "the Conmunist on-
Slaught in order to maintain the security and inde-
pene A of the Associated States, Viet Nam, Cambodia,
and Laos

e. There was agreement that it was desirable
to build up the native Indochinese forces as rapidly
as possible, but we held out no hope for the provision
of US budgetary assistance for the National Army in
Indochina, stating that we continue to believe that we
cannot become directly involved in local budgetary
deficits of other countries.

f. "The President informed the Prime Minister
that United States aid for the French Union forces and
for the National Armies of the Associated States will
continue, and that the increased quantities of material
to be delivered under the program authorized for the
current fiscal year will be expedited." Additional
measures for US aid to Indochina included: 1) an indi-
cation of our willingness to relax the original re-
'strictions placed on the use by the French of the US
aircraft carrier Langley in the Mediterranean in view
of cur inability to provide another US carrier for
service in Indochina; and 2) an agreement to study the
possibility of reallocating funds now available in an
effort to \ provide equipment for four Vietnamese divisions.

g. The President said that the United States was
agreeable to US, UK, French Renee OU ca on
Indochinese matters.

h. In the event of a Chinese Communist attack m
Indochina, the US agreed to give all possible assistance
in the evacuation of French forces if such action be-
comes necessary. The extent of the aid would be limited
by other demands on our forces, such as Korea, which
exist at the time any request for assistance is made.
