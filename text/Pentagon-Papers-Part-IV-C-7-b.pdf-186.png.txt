at Haiphong and other ports. In other words, even from a
military standpoint the effect of closins the Port of
Haiphong would be to impose an impediment only for a period
of time, and to add to difficulties which Hanoi has shown
in the past it can overcome. Politically, moreover, closing
the Port of Haiphong continues to raise a serious question
of Soviet reaction. Ambassador Thompson, Governor Harriman,
and others believe that the Soviets would be compelled to
react in some manner -- at a minimum through the use of
minesweepers and possibly through protective naval action
of some sort. Again, we continue to believe that there

is some kind of "flash point” both in terms of these likely
actions and their implications for our relation with the
Soviets in other matters, and for such more remote -- but
not inconceivable -- possibilities as Soviet compensating
pressure elsewhere, for example against Berlin. Even a
small risk of a significant confrontation with the Soviets
must be given major weight against the limited military
gains anticipated from this action.

Finally, by throwing the budden of supply onto the
rail and road lines through China, the mining of Haiphong
would tend to increase Chinese leverage in Hanoi and would
force the Soviets and the Chinese to work out cooperative
arrangements for their new and enlarged transit. We do
not believe this would truly drive the Soviets and Chinese
together, but it would force them to take a wider range of
common positions that would certainly not be favorable to
our basic interests.

These operations, expanded north along the coast to
Haiphong and to other port areas, would include provision
for avoiding ocean-going ships, while hitting coast-wise
shipping assumed to be North Vietnamese.

We believe this distinction will not be easy to apply
without error, and that therefore the course of action
involves substantial risks of serious complications with
Chirese ard other shipping. In view of the extensive
measures already authorized further south, we doubt if
the gains to be achieved would warrant these risks.
