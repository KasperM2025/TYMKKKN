MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY FINLETTER

SUBJECT: Indo-China

Item 1. Sr. NSC Staff Agenda, Thursday, 19 October, 2:30 p.m,

The Southeast Asia Policy Committee has prepared the
attached, which furnishes background and a proposed policy.
This is now under review by the Joint Secretaries and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff,

Military Aid

We have been giving military aid to the French and
Vietnamese in Indo-China, The Melby-Erakine Mission have com-
pleted a survey as to the needs. We Are preparing to give
greater aid, and according to priorities to be furnished by
Brigadier General Brink, USA, Chief of MAG, now on the spot in
the Tonkin area, As you know, this speed-up has been under
discussion with the French authorities this past week, A total
of 6 French battalions have either been destroyed or isolated
by the Viet Minhs, This leaves 15 Battalions available to the
French to oppose about twice that number of Viet Minhs, with
some 300 miles of the Chinese border open, with an open line of
supply from China and with some 10,000 Vietnam troops in
training in China, The French are planning to retreat further
but to hold the Delta area, They should be able to hold, with
the addition of || replacement battalions now enroute and the
capability of moving some other troops from Cochin China, The
arrival of General Juin and the French Minister for Colonies
should ensure an adequate appraisal of the situation,

Political Steps

With our eye on the main objective in Western Europe and
our policy against colonialism, and for nationalism (except
where our worthwhile allies would be unduly weakened) our ends
could best be served by bringing about on the part of the Franch:

a, Definite announcement by the French of a

decision on their part to phase out their political government in
Indochina (action on their part similar to ours in the Philippines)
