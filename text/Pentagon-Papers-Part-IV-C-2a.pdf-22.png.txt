approach was expanded: Lodge sug-
gested a third country- interlocu-
teur be selected to tell Hanoi of
U.S. resolve, that the threat of
air strikes be combined with an
economic assistance offer and that
as part of the "carrot" the U.S.
offer to withdraw some personnel
from South Vietnam.

Rusk wanted the extent of NVN in-
filtration and support to be satis-
factorily proved to U.S. citizens,
allies and neutrals; he wanted
Asian military support for the U.S.
Rusk did not think China would
intervene militarily without Soviet
support and thought we could pressure
the Chinese economically through
our allies. He doubted elimination
of DRV industrial targets would
have much adverse impact on any NVN
decision to stop aiding the insur-
gency.

Results: Canada would be asked to
act as interlocuteur. Also, Sec-
retary Rusk recommended the U.S.
seek "more flags" to support the
GVN, deploy a carrier task force
to Cam Ranh Bay to establish a
permanent U.S. Naval presence,
initiate anti-junk operations to
“inch northward" along the coast
and enlist SEATO support in isolating
the DRV from economic or cultural
relations with the Free World.

23 Apr 64 '  SecDef Memorandum This forwarded the 20 April scenario
to CJCS which contained three stages: wn-

committing steps to be taken now;
graduated overt pressures on the
DRV (FARMGATE); and a contingency
plan for overt U.S. response to
DRV/CHICOM escalation. The first
stage could stand alone, but stage
two could not be launched unless
the U.S. ‘was prepared to take the
third step -- perhaps within 10 days
of the previous "D-Day."
