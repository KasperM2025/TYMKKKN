A summary of existing policy on Indochina reveals the JCS

view on NSC 73 that the U.S. give consideration to provid-

ing air and naval assistance should the Chinese provide

overt support to the Viet Minh. Consultants’ Meeting,

The U.S. feels that French requests for overall assistance
(military, economic, and political) are inadequate to

“consummate U.S. broad objectives in Indochina" and assis-

tance will have to be increased to resist encroachment of
communism. Heath (Saigon) 170 to Acheson, 7 August 1950.... 343

The U.S. views growing political and military deterioration

in Indochina with concern; especially evident are failure

of the government to gain support, disinclination of Bao

Dai to assume leadership role, and indications of CHICOM-

Viet Minh military collaboration. The U.S. seeks to have

Vietnam establish a national army and declare a national
emergency. Acheson 238 to Saigon, 1 September 1950......... 3h}

The U.S. informs France that the U.S. was prepared to in-

crease assistance to French Union forces but could not

furnish money for local use or direct tactical air support.

The Southeast Asia Aid Policy Committee (SEAC) proposes a
statement of U.S. policy on Indochina to the NSC for con-
sideration. "The U.S. will not commit any of its armed

forces to the defense of Indochina against overt, foreign

aggression....” but should assist in the "formation of

new national armies of the three Associated States." The

U.S. should also "press the French" to carry out the

agreements of 8 March 1949 and 30 December 1949. SEAC

"The draft statement of U.S. policy in Indochina is weak

from the political side....the Defense representatives

arguei for a strong, hardhitting peclicy cn political and

economic concessions. The State Department representatives
flatly refused....to consider Indochina in that manner.
Consequently, the paper ended with a compromise." K. T.
