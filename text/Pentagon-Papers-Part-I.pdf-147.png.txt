DESCRIPIION

A Saigon centered, left-wing communist
faction opposed to the French and to the
Viet Minh alike. Principal significance
was its continued impairment of communist
effectiveness in Cochinchina.

Formed in Nanking in February, 1947, by
VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi leaders; gained
support of Tran Trong Kim (Bao Dai's
premier in the March-August 1945 government) ,
Nguyen Hai Than (Ho's onetime Dong Minh Hoi
Vice President), and Nguyen Tuong Tam
(VNQDD, sometime Foreign Minister of the.
DRV). Claimed to unite the VNQDD, the Dong
Minh Hoi, the Cao Dai, and the Buddhists
behind Bao Dai, but splintered with with-
drawal of sect supporters, and under impact
of French political maneuvers.

Re-established in China in 1946, but never
again influential in Vietnam; probably
numbered 5,000 or less. When war broke

out, sought reconciliation with Viet Minh,
but was rebuffed. Swung to Bao Dai, al-
though supporting a hard line with theâ€™ French.

Enjoyed prestige of tradition dating to
1930's, but fortunes waned with Chiang
Kai-shek's, with whom it had associated
itself closely. Probably numbered 5,000

or less, and influence within Vietnam
largely confined to Hanoi, and to northern
Tonkin, in Viet Minh heartland. Support for
Bao Dai highly tentative and heavily condi-
tioned.
