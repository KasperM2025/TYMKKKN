of movements be furnished the ICC, and specified points of entry and
departure be employed. Neither the DRV nor the GVN cooperated with
the ICC in all respects. The U.S., though it took steps to maintain
the appearances of compliance through 1960, especially on personnel
ceilings, and although it considered itself hampered by the Settlement,
was able to provide in that time over $50,000,000 per annum worth of
military assistance to the GVN. 82/ ‘The failure of the Geneva Settle-
ment to control the arming of Vietnam, with its concomitant heightened
fears and potential for violence, no less than in the case of the
plebescite and the refugees, was directly antecedent to the insurgency
in South Vietnam.

2. PAVN Modernizes

At the close of hostilities, the Viet Minh probably had
some 300,000 to 400,000 men under arms -- about 130,000 regulars --
of which all but about 70,000 were concentrated in North Vietnam and
laos. (See Map, ff.) 83/ The French had fielded 420,000 troops,
including about 200,000 Vietnamese. Both sides received extensive aid
from non-combatants, the French chiefly from the U.S., and the DRV
chiefly fran China. One recent estimate puts relative volumes of aid

as follows: 84/

COMPARISON OF TONNAGE OF U.S. AID TO FRANCE
WITH CHINESE COMMUNIST AID TO VIET MINH

U.S. Aid : Chinese Aid
1951 7,200 tons/month | 10 to 20 tons/month
1953 10,000 tons/month 500 +0 600 tons/month
1954 nea. _ 4,000 tons/month (as of Dien
Bien Phu)

The differences between the two aid programs were, of course, signifi-
cant beyond tonnages. The Chinese aid was largely infantry arms and
ammunition, while U.S. shipments ranged across the whole costly and
complicated inventory of the U.S. armed forces. More importantly, in
contrast with the highly visible U.S. participation, Chinese aid was
clandestine; neither the donor nor the recipient has owned to the aid
program to this date, and in maintaining the flow without attribution
the DRV developed procedures which stood it in good stead after Geneva.

The DRV, from all U.S. intelligence has been able to dis-
cern, commenced the reorganization and refitting of its Peoples’ Army
of Vietnam (PAVN) concurrently with occupation of Tonkin behind the
withdrawing French. U.S. evidence indicated that shipments of military
materiel from China and the Soviet significantly exceeded in kind and
