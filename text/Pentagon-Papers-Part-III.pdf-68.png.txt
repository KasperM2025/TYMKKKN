ec. U.S. Declines to Support Final GVN Position

When the penultimate session of the Conference recessed,
Tran Van Do and another member of his delegation, Tran Van Chuong, explained
Vietnam's position to U. Alexis Johnson. Even though they admitted that
they recognized the impracticality of the GVN proposals, the GVN delegation
felt that "they must make the moral position of their government clear to
the world and to the Vietnamese people. If the other side rejected it,
the position of their government would have been improved." U. Alexis
Johnson observed that time was short for another plenary session; he suggested
that they ask Mendes-France for an extension of his self-imposed deadline
for concluding the negotiations. After some hesitation, they did so, and
Mendes-France, although he urged the Vietnamese to circulate their proposal,
stated he definitely could not ask the French National Assembly for more time
at Geneva. Johnson at this point "reminded Mendes-France of the U.S. posi-
â€˜tion on GVN concurrence with any agreement.- Mendes-France [saia/ he was
very conscious of this and was askingDe Jean [sic/ immediately to go to
Cannes to see Bao Dai." 38/ Nothing came of this exchange.

In summary, however, it must be said that while the GVN attained none
of its major objectives, and while it received little support from the
U.S., it continued to exist. Its territorial and political integrity
below the 17th parallel was assured, after a fashion, for at least two
years by the Geneva Accords. d
