our own political position needs now to be built on a clearer
and stronger statement of objectives from Saigon itself.

Once this stronger position of Saigon is established, the
US could adi its own support and its own ietermination to be
guided by the freely exnressed wishes of the people of South
Vietnam. It could express its readiness to give peaceful help
to such a settled country, and it could reaffirm its readiness
to participate in appropriate international guarantees. It
could also reaffirm its determination to support the GVN until
this program is accepted.

But the "strong GYN progrem" Bundy had in mind clearly did not con-
template any serious compromise with the NLF. It was a politically
strengthened, internationally guaranteed, Western-oriented government
Bundy was seeking to create -- at least in appearance if not in reality.
The grinding problem of the ultimate role of the NLF was left unaddressed
and in limbo:

The probability is that any such program would and should
leave open the exact opportunities open to the Liberation
Front and its members in the new politics of South Vietnam.
This is as it should be, since this point is precisely the one
which can only be settled by events and bargaining.

It is a striking fact that, in April, 1968, three years later, this

erucial point was still viewed as one which can only be settled by events
and bargaining.
