"You could understand even better if you were able to see
what is happening here, if you were able to sense this desire
for independence which has been smoldering in the bottom of all
hearts, and which no human force can any longer hold back. Even
if you were to arrive to re-establish a French administration
here, it would no longer be obeyed; each village would be a nest
of resistance, every former friend an enemy, and your officials
and colonists themselves would ask to depart from this unbreathable
atmosphere.

"IT beg you to understand that the only way to safeguard French

peace and the joy which has rung for all the people of the world
will be guaranteed equally to all people who live in Indochina,

The overturning of Japanese power in Cochinchina followed
a separate course. Bao Dai's government had waited until August 14, 1945

to proclaim the incorporation of Cochinchina into a united Vietnam, but

this move came much too late to have any impact. The first effective steps
toward consolidating the disunited Vietnamese political groups in the South
was undertaken by the Trotskyist "Struggle" faction and formerly collabora-
tionist parties, who merged on August 14, 1945, to form a "United National
Front" (Mat Tran Quoc Thong Nhut). Participants included the Cao Dai League,
the Hoa Hao Sect, and the Buddhist League. The United National Front adopted
the Trotskyist platform, and directed its energies principally against

Bao Dai's representatives in Saigon. The Viet Minh seems to have delayed
until 2 August to launch its program in Cochinchina, apparently moving

at that time in response to the seizure of power by the Viet Minh in Annam
and Tonkin. In the meantime, the ICP, led by Tran Van Giau, quietly seized
