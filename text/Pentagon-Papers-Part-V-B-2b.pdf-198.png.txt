Se United States objectives, policies, and courses of
action in Asia should be designed to contribute toward the global
objectives of strengthening the free world vis-a-vis the Soviet
orbit, and should be determined with due regard to the relation
of United States capabilities and commitments throughout the
world, However, in view of the communist resort to armed force
in Asia, United States action in that area must be based on the
recognition that the most immediate threats to United States
security are currently presented in that area, :

4, Current Soviet tactics appear to concentrate on bringing
the mainland of Eastern Asia and eventually Japan and the other
principal off-shore islands in the Western Pacific under Soviet
control, primarily through Soviet exploitation of the resources
of communist China, The attainment of this objective on the
mainland of Eastern Asia would substantially enhance the global
position of the USSR at the expense of the United States, by
securing the eastern flank of the USSR and permitting the USSR .
to concentrate its offensive power in other areas, particularly
in Europe, Soviet control of the off-shore islands in the
Western Pacific, including Japan, would present an unacceptable
threat to the security of the United States,

5. Asia is of strategic importanceto the United States,

a. The strategic significance of Asia arises from its
resources, geography, and the political and military force
wnich it could generate. The population of the area is
about 1,250,000,000, The demonstrated military capacity
of the North Korean and Chinese armies requires a re-
evaluation of the threat to the free world which the masses
of Asia would constitute if they fell under Soviet Communist
domination, . :

5, The resources of Asia contribute greatly to United
States security by helping to meet its need for critical
materials and they would be of great assistance in time of
war if they remained available, At least until stockpiling
levels are met, this phase of the areats importance to the
United States will continue, Further, the development of
events which might lead to the exhaustion of such stockpiles
would magnify ‘the importance of this source of supply. The
area produces practically all the world's natural rubber,
nearly 5% of the oil, 60% of the tin, the major part of
‘various important tropical products, and strategic materials
such as manganese, jute, and atomic materials, Japan's
potential in heavy industry is roughly equal to 50% of the
Soviet Union's present production, Therefore, it is
