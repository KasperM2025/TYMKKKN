Regarding the U.S. view of a Ho Chi Minh electoral victory, we not
only have the well-known comment of Eisenhower that Ho, at least in
1954, would have garnered 80 per cent of the vote, but also the
privately expressed view of Livingston Merchant (Dept. of State) that
Ho would be the likely Winner. See the latter in Dept.:of State
Memorandum of Conversation of May 31, 1954, at which Merchant report-
edly "felt their /the Associated States'/7 status was sufficiently
independent so that they could freely express their will on a point of
this type, although he recognized the possibility that in Viet Nam Ho
might win a plebiscite, if held today." (TOP SECRET).
