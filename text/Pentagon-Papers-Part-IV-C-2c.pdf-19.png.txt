William Bundy Memo

_ to Rusk

DESCRIPTION

against the North, and U.S. air
escort for returning GVN naval
craft,

Secretary Rusk appears on a Sun-
day TV interview program and
defends U.S. policy, ruling out
either a U.S. withdrawal or a
major expansion of the wer. The
public and Congressional debate on
the war had heated up considerably
since the Army take-over in South
Vietnam in December. The debate
continues through January with
Senator Morse the most vocal and
sharpest critic of the Administra-
tion.

Renewing their earlier efforts, the
Soviets call again for a conference
on the Laotian problem.‚Äù

The Principals disapprove the JCS

. recommendation for VNAF strikes

with unmarked aircraft against the
North. The JCS voice concern at
the failure to begin planning for
Phase II of the pressures program.
But no decision to go ahead is

taken.

Tn view of the continued deterior-
ation of the-situation in the South
and the prevailing view that the
U.S. was going to seek a way out,
Bundy recommended some limited meas-
ures, short of Phase IT (i.e. recce,
@ reprisal, evacuation of U.S. de-
pendents, etc.), to strengthen our
hand. There were risks in this
course but it would improve our
position with respect to the other
SEA nations if things got rapidly
worse in SVN and we had to con-
template a withdrawal.
