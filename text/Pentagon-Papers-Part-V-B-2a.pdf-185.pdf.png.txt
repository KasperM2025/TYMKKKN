WASHINGTON.

I have the honor to refer to tho Department's secret circular
yinstruction of October 13, 1948,¥ entitled "Pattern of Soviet Policy
in Par East and Southeast Asia" and to submit certain comments, as
requested by the Department. ceed

;

Soviet policy in Indochina sppears to follow in general the
lines described in the final seotion of the instruction under ac-+
imowledgemons but with certain minor variation. In general it may
be said’that Indochine presents an ideal picture from the point of
view of Koscov. A small group of Moscow and Chinese trained Cor-
munists has firm control of the strong and decp seated native
Nationalism A native government under Communist direction controls
considerable areas of the country and maintains an army sufficiontly
strong to pin dovm large freuch forces. The country has been kept
in turmoil since the end of the war, making it a serious drain on
the military and economic resources of France instead of a sources

\of wealth. From the point of view of Moscow, prospects are or

, lent that Eo Chi JIINH will eventually force the withdrawal of the ; =

_French and set up the first "New Democratic Republic” in Southeast :
Asia. At ths same time Communist control has been concealed and

“identified with Kationalism so suecessfully as to confuse and j
delude public opinion in France and the United States and thus gain

the support of large Socialist and liberal groups in those countries.
