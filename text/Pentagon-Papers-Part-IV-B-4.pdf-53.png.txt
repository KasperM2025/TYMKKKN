Vietnam, Mr. McNamara identified measures that "will involve a limited
increase in U.S. personnel and in direct Defense Department costs. More
significantly they involve significant increases in Military Assistance
Program costs....," plus "additional U.S. economic aid to support the
increased GVN budget." The estimated additional annual MAP costs would
come to between $30 and $40 million each year, plus a one-time additional
cost of $20 million for military equipment. In the recommendation section
