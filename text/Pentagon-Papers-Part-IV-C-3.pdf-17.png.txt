In a memo to McNamara, Wheeler

able link in the transportation

psychological value of targets is
already beginning to enter discus-
sions,

Unable to rally support in the Armed
Forces Council, Khanh resigns. 1

In a meeting in Warsaw the Chinese
are informed that while the U.S.
will continue to take those actions
required to defend itself and South
Vietnam, it has no aggressive in-
tentions toward the DRV.

The State Department issues a "White
Paper‚Äù detailing its charges of ag-
gression against North Vietnam,

U.S. and GVN make simultaneous an-
nouncement of decision to open a
continuous limited air campaign
against the North in order to bring
about a negotiated settlement on
favorable terms,

104 USAF planes attack Xom Bang ammo
depot and 19 VNAF aircraft hit the
Quang Khe Naval Base in the first

Chief of Staff, Gen. H.K. Johnson,
to Saigon to explore with Taylor and
Westmoreland what additional efforts
can be made to improve the situation
in the South, complementarily to the
strikes against the North.

tion on Vietnam without conditions
on either side,
