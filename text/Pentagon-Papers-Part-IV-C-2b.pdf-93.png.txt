FOOTNOTES

Baltimore Sun, 22 May 196).

On 6 and 7 June two U.S, Navy reconnaissance aircraft were shot

down over Laos by communist ground-fire. The United States requested
and received permission to furnish armed escort reconnaissance
flights, and on 9 June, U.S. aircraft struck Pathet Lao gun posi-
tions and damaged a Pathet Lao headquarters. Souvanna Phouma
temporarily withdrew his permission for armed escort in response

to vigorous DRV and Chinese protests, but renewed it on 12 June.
