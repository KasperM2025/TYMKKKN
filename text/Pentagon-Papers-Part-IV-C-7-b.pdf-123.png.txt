b. DRV Reaction Time and US Detection of
Changes

(1) Under conditions of bombing, NVN
units and infiltration groups have taken from only a few
days up to eight months to infiltrate to a CTZ. US
detection and identification may take up to six months,
or longer, and confirmation even longer. Following
cessation, infiltration rates would be brought closer
to minimum time.

(2) Given its present capability to
expand its training base by almost 100%, the DRV could
achieve a significant increase in present pipeline level
of infiltration in about 3 months following decision to
expand its training base.

(3) The DRV could regenerate major
segments of its economic infrastructure in 6 months,
its LOC in NVN in 30-60 days, its logistic system in
12 months. Port congestion would be alleviated. Materiel
transit time would be significantly reduced.

ec. Capabilities Over Time
10-15 days:

-- reinforce NVA forces at DMZ with
up to 5 division equivalents. Allied/enemy battalion
ratios in I CTZ could shift from 1.7/1 to 0.9/1

--increase artillery bombardment from
beyond DMZ, and reinforce AAA and SAM units.

30-60 days:

--Restore to operational use major
ports and LOC within NVN, to include RR, highway, and
combination RR/highway bridges; airfields; and over half
of the vehicle repair facilities.

--Accomplish a restructuring (depots,
shelters, alternate routes) of the logistic system within
NVN to increase the flexibility of the LOC in Laos.

2-6 months:

--Achieve undetected a new position of
military advantage in SVN, through increased infiltration,
with at least two divisions in place in SVN, and three
others in transit.
