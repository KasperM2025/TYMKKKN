An experienced French journalist in Indochina wrote: "To be sure,
American officers also tried to supervise strategy; but after a few
fruitless brushes with a high command that was ferociously attached
to its prerogatives they decided to leave it entirely to the French.
In the end all the experts of the Military Aid Advisory Group kept
in the background, resigning themselves to letting this Indochinese
war be fought in the French way."
