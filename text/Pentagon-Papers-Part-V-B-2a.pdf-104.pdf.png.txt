31. There is growing conviction in Viet Nam cireles that principal
point involved in Paris negotiations will be future status of Cochin
China and how tt will he determined.

Viet Namece cenerally acree that without Coehin China any inde-
pendence will be largely theoretical.

Viet Nam position regarding referendum anpears to have under-
gone extensive changes. Ho Chi Minh when he signed convention
of March 6th was convinced that in any “fair™ referendum Cochin
“China would not fvote?] to attach itself to Viet Nam.

However, Datat Conference delevation apparently retnimed to
Hanoi with realization that Viet Nam strength in Cochin China was
diminishing. This they attribute fo French propaganda and absence
of freedom for their own agents.

Realization of diminishing Viet Nam streneth in Cochin China is
probably principal reason why Ho accompanied delegation to Paris.
He hopes to reach satisfactory solution on this all-important question
on basis of numerous friendships which he has with Left Wing French
circles.
