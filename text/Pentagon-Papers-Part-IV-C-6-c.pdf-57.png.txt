The memorandum recapitulated General Westmoreland's request for

personnel and indicated that General Wheeler believed that we should
meet this request, and should act to increase and improve our strategic
reserve in the United States. To achieve both these goals, the paper
stated, staff examination indicated that the following actions would be

required:

a. A call-up of reserve units and individuals totaling
approximately 262,000 (194,000 in units, 68,000 as individuals).

bd. Increased draft calls.

ec. Extension of terms of service. These actions would preduce
a total increase in end strength in the Armed Forces of approxi-
mately 511,000 by June 30, 1969. (The staff examination referred
to above included spaces to add 31,500 troops in South Korea and
a US naval proposal to add two cruisers and fifteen destroyers to
the naval forces in Southeast Asia. If these proposals are
disapproved in their entirety, the figures above will be decreased
to approximately 242,000 and 454,000 respectively.

The Secretary of Defense then recommended:

1. An immediate decision to deploy to Vietnam an estimated
total of 22,000 additional personnel (approximately 60% of which
would be combat). An immediate decision to deploy the three
tactical fighter squadrons deferred from Program 5 (about 1,000
men). This would be over and above the four battalions (about 3700
men) already planned for deployment in April which in themselves
would bring us slightly above the 525,000 authorized level....

2. Wither through Ambassador Bunker or through an early
visit by Secretary Clifford, a highly forceful approach to the GVN
(Thieu and Ky) to get certain key commitments for improvement,
tied to our own increased effort and to increased US support for
the ARVN....

3. Early approval of a Reserve call-up and an increased end
strength adequate to meet the balence of the Westmoreland request
and to restore a strategic reserve in the United States, adequate
for possible contingencies world-wide....

lh. Reservation of the decision to meet the Westmoreland request
in full. While we would be putting ourselves in a position to make
these additionel deployments, the future decision to do so would
be contingent upon:
