3. Asia is an area of significant potential power--political,
economic and military. The development in this region of stable
and independent countries friendly to the United States end seeking
to direct their potential power.into constructive channels would
enhance the security of Asia and strengthen the world position of
the United States. Conversely, the domination of Asia by a nation
or coalition of nations capable of exploiting the region for pur-
poses of self-aggrandizement would threaten the security of Asia
and of the United States. Recognition of these principles has been
implicit in our traditional policies toward Asia; We have consis-
tently favored a system of independent states and Genesee aggeran~=
dizement of any powers which threatened eventual domination of the
region.

4, Our over-all objective with Pee Asia must be to
assist in the development of truly independent, friendly, stable
and self-sustaining states in conformity with the purposes and
principles of the United Nations Charter, In order to achieve this,
- we must concurrently oppose the domination of Asia by any single
country or coalition. It is gonesdvenic that in the course of time
@ threat of domination may come from such nations as Japan, China,
or India, or from an Asiatic bloc. But now and for the foreseeable
future it is the USSR which threatens to dominate Asia through the
complementary instruments of ‘comminist conspiracy and diplomatic
pressure supported by military strength... For the foreseeable
future, therefore, our immediate objective must be to contain and

where feasible to reduce the power and influence of the USSR in
