Secretary McNemara put down his views on priorities in a Memorandum

be withdrawn as soon as possible and not later than six
months after the above conditions have been fulfilled. }/

from the beginning of October, and although they were reluctant, Thieu
and Ky finally agreed on October 20 to proclaim the new program, called
