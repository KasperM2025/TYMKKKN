Summary of conclusions reached at the Fifth

Meeting of the United States/United Kingdom/
France Ministerial Talks held at Lancaster
House on Saturdey, 14th May, at 10.30 aemi/

Is Item 5: South East Asia (MIN/TRI/P/9)

le M. SCHUMAN gave a short review of French commit-
ments in Indo-China and explained the difficulties
facing the French Government. He emphasised that it
should be recognised thet France wes serving the
interests of the common cause and that the French
Government needed urgently extensive military help.

26 Ihe Ministers agreed that paragraph 7 should be
amended to read:

7e Although the security of South Gast Asia is
of strategic importance to the United States, the
British and French have direct responsibilities
in the area which make its security of even
greater concern to them. The forcible expulsion
of French and British forces from â€˜Indo-China

and tlalaya, respectively, would be both a mili-
tary and politicel disaster. The United Kin dom
-therefore reaffirms its intention to continue

to discharge its responsibilities in British and
British~protected territory in the area. The
French Government considers that it is only
within the framework of close and active co-
operation with the United Kinsdom and United
States Governments that it will be able to
continue effectively to discharge its warticular
responsibilities in this region."
