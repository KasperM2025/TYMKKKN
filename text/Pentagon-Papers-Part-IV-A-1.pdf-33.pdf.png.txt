(3) “After appropriate build-up, to launch a counter offen-
Sive, including a major amphibious assault on North Vietnam, to
inflict a decisive defeat on enemy military forces and at the
same time liberate occupied territory." 60f/ 1
Plan 5 provided U.S. troops to release the Royal Laotion forees for
offensive operations and to assist them "to regain areas lost." The
U.S. would also provide “additional military and logistic support."

This was a fully developed and approved plan, for which "the Field Force
Commander's plan is complete." 61/ Plan 6 provided for the defense of
the protocol states against attack by forces of the DRV. The general
concept was:

(1) "Po hold the enemy as far forward as possible and to
provide defense in depth, securing main ports of entry and
bases for build-up and deployment of forces for counter-offensive."
(2) "To destroy the enemy's forces, LOC's and capacity to
wage war through an intensive interdiction program conducted by
SEATO air and naval forces supported by such air and naval forces
under national command as are made available."

(3) "While maintaining the defense, forces for the counter-
offensive phase will be assembled and built up. When appropriate,
a general offensive to include a major amphibious assault against
North Vietnam will be mounted to inflict a decisive defeat on the
enemy military forces and to liberate the territory overrun by

the DRV." 62/

U.S. ground force commitment to the plans was a corps consisting of
three infantry divisions plus a Marine Expeditionary Force of one division.
Air support was a tactical bomber squadron, two tactical fighter squad-
rons, and a Marine air wing. Anticipated support of the plans by other
SEATO countries is evident in available ground force troop lists for
plans 4 and 6: €3/
