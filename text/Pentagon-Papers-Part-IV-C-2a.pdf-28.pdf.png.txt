DESCRIPEION_

OR: The ExCom explicitly assumed
that a decision to use force if
necessary -- backed by resolute
deployment and conveyed every way
possible "...gives the best present
chance of avoiding the actual use
of such force." Other actions
recommended were: communicate U.S,
resolve through the Canadian inter-
loeuteur; call a high-level South-
east Asian strategy conference;
begin diplomatic efforts at the UN
to present the case for DRV aggres-
sion; consult with SEATO allies

and obtain allied force commitments;
seek a Congressional Resolution in
support of U.S. resistance to NVN
in SEA; deploy forces periodically
to the region; consider an initial
strike against NVN "designed to
have more deterrent than destructive
impact" and accomapny it by an active
diplomatic offensive to restore
stability -- including an agreement
to a Geneva Conference.

Lodge said only firm action against
North Vietnam by the U.S. and GVN
could lead to a significant improve-
ment in the GVN effort. (A "new
wrinkle" in Lodge's view.)

Poland proposed a Laos conference
format which avoided many undesir-
able aspects of those formerly
supported by communist governments.

The ExCom, preferring to initially
treat Laos independently of Vietnam,
recommended the President accept

the Polish proposal. The U.S. would
not be willing to write off Laos to
the communists and would assure
Souvanna: "We would be prepared

to give him prompt and direct mili-
tary support if the Polish Con-
ference..." failed.
