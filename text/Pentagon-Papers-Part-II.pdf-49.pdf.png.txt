to a basic incompatibility in the two strands of American policy:

(1) Washington wanted France to fight the war and win, preferably with
American guidance and advice; and (2) having achieved success at great
cost in what the French viewed at least initially as more a “colonial”
than "anti-communist" war, Washington expected the French to withdraw
magnanimously. (A Frenchman might have asked how France, even if it
wished to, could have left Indochina without creating similar pressures
for withdrawal from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, where over one million
Frenchmen lived.) In this inherent inconsistency can be found much of
the explanation for the lack of American leverage over France during the
pre-Geneva years.
