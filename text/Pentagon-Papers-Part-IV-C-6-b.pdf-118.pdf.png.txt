deployed to meet these goals.

Additional forces will add additional cost, further
-degrading public opinion and preventing expansion of
critical domestic programs. They would present the
prospect of unending escalation, splitting the American
public even more openly and seriously. 6/

These goals, of course, differed greatly from those outlined by the
Joint Chiefs in JCSM 702-66 in November and JCSM 218-67 in April.

The military aims in the Systems Analysis memo were passive in nature,
and obviously based upon new assumptions about the likelihood of
success, and therefore were directed toward much different terminal
goals than those the JCS proposed.

The recommendations made by Systems Analysis were based upon two
fundamental arguments: (1) That the additional forces were unlikely
to increase vc/NVA losses beyond any level intolerable to the enemy;
and (2) that the additional forces would not help the pacification task
measurably. a It argued: ?

Additional forces are very unlikely to increase
vc/NVA losses beyond any levelintolerable to the enemy.
Assuming that the enemy has no control over his losses,
the table below shows projected enemy losses. Only
when the projection is based on recent peak losses does
the rate of enemy losses exceed the rate at which MACV
and USIB agree the enemy can go on replacing them indef-
initely, and then only by 139 per week for the MACV
"minimum essential" force, and 431 for the "optimum" force.
Even at a decrease in enemy forces of 431 per week, over
10 years would be needed to eliminate the enemy.
