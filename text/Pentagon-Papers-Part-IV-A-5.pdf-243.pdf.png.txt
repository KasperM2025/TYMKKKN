(3) assistance in fiscal matters; and
(4) improvement of Pathet Lao military forces.

A captured report to Hanoi, probably from this head-
quarters, indicated that by 1956 the Laotian Communist Party had
expanded from less than 100 to more than 2,000 members, and that a
light infantry, guerrilla force of more than fifteen battalions had been
created. Apparently, Hanoi had planned to withdraw the Vietnamese cadre
in late 1956, and there is evidence that some withdrawals took place by
early 1957; there is also evidence that most DRV cadre remained. However,
in 1957, with the aid of the ICC, a political settlement was reached.

Two battalions of Pathet Iao surrendered to the Royal Laotian Govern-
ment (RIG), to be incorporated into its army, and the Pathet Lao agreed
to demobilize 5,000 other troops. Two officials of the Lao Fatherland
Front were admitted to the Royal Laotian Government, and the movement
ostensibly integrated into the national community.

During 1958 and early 1959, the Royal Laotian Govern-
ment became increasingly pro-Western, and DRV activities in Iaos were
evidently attenuated. However, in May, 1959, when the Royal Laotian
Army (RIA) attempted to disestablish its two Pathet Lao battalions,
one escaped and marched for the DRV. DRV reaction was quick. Inme-
diately thereafter U.S. intelligence was reliably informed that a
military headquarters similar to the Viet Minh's Dien Bien Phu command \
post had been set up near the Iaos border to control operations in Laos
by the NVA 335th Division, which hed been formed from the "Lao Volunteers"
regrouped to the DRV in 1955. 198/ From mid-1959 onwards, the U.S.
acquired convincing evidence of an increasing DRV military involvement
in Iaos, and beginning in late 1960, of USSR entry into the conflict
with substantial military aid for the Pathet lao. The Pathet Lao aided
by a severe weakening of the RIG fran a neutralist coup by Kong le in ~
1961, and a counter coup by right-wing forces in 1962, mounted an
offensive against the RLG to expand Pathet Iao controlled territory,
which continued through a "cease-fire" of May, 1961.

It was not, however, until December, 1960, that the DRV
announced to foreign diplomats resident in Hanoi its decision to inter-
vene in Laos; during 1961 the DRV presence in laos was transformed from
a semi-covert MAAG-like undertaking to an operational theater. Beginning
in Decenber, 1960, and throughout 1961 and early 1962, Soviet aircraft
flew 2,000 to 3,000 sorties from the DRV to Laos, delivering more than
3,000 tons of supplies to communist forces, which expanded their terri-
tory to hold the northern half of the country. Ethnic North Vietnamese
appeared in Pathet Lao formations, and Kong le himself admitted that
NVA officers and soldiers were serving as "technicians" with his paratroops.
North Vietnamese from NVA formations were captured by RLG forces and cap-
tured documents substantiated the presence of entire NVA units. In
December, 1961, a convoy of Soviet-made tanks was sighted entering laos
