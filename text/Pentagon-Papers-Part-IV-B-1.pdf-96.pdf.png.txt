evaluation shows that the military situation at present
is to the advantage of the communists and that most of
the Vietnamese Armed Forces are already committed to in-
ternal security and the protection of our 12 million
inhabitants, For many months the communist-inspired
fratricidal war has taken nearly one thousand casualties
@ month on both sides, Documents obtained in a recent
operation, along route No. 9 which runs from Laos to
Vietnam, contain definite proof that 2,860 armed agents
have infiltrated among us in the course of the last four
months, It is certain that this number rises each day.
However, the Vietnamese people are showing the world that
they are willing to fight and die for their freedom, not
withstanding the temptations to neutralism and its false
promises of peace being drummed into their ears daily by
the communists, ~

In the light of this Situation, the council of generals
concluded that additional forces numbering slightly over
100,000 more than our new force level of 170,000 will be
required to counter the ominous threat of communist domi-
nation...

After considering the recommendations of our generals and
consulting with our American military advisors, we now
conclude that to provide even minimum initial resistance
to the threat, two new divisions of approximately 10,000
strength each are required to be activated at the earliest
possible date, Our lightly held defensive positions along
the demilitarized zone at our Northern border is even
today being outflanked by communist forces which have
defeated the Royal Laotian Army garrisons in Tchepone and
other cities in Southern Laos. Our ARVN forces are so
thoroughly committed to internal anti-guerrilla operations
that we have no effective forces with which to counter this
threat from Southern Laos. Thus, we needâ€™ immediately one
division for the First Army Corps and one for the Second
Army Corps to provide at least some token resistance to the
Sizeable forces the communists are capable of bringing to
bear against our Laotian frontier, Failing this, we would
have no recourse but to withdraw our forces southward from
the demilitarized zone and sacrifice progressively greater

x
Diem's number implies an infiltration rate about 4 times as high
as that estimated by U.S. intelligence in 1961, and twice as high
as the hindsight revised 1961 estimates now in use.
