4) Associated States. M. Parodi raised the
question of participation of the three Associated
States of Indochina. Mr. Dulles stated that he did
not think the U.S. would be opposed in principle to
such participation provided it did not constitute a
precedent and commit the U.S. to treating these
States as in all respects sovereign for other pur-
poses, for example membership in the U.N., as to which
matter Mr. Dulles did not know what U.S. policy would
be. Mr. Dulles stated however that he anticipated
that some of the other prospective co-signers, such.
as India, Burma and Indonesia, might object to signing
with the three Associated States as sovereign, par-
ticularly as there was a rival government of Viet
. Minh recognized by the Soviet bloc. He said that if
this created serious difficulties it might be neces-
sary for these States to participate through subsequent
identical bilateral pacts with Japan. M. Parodi
reiterated that it was very important for France to
secure recognition of the independent sovereign status
of these States.
