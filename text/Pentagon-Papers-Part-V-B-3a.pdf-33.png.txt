The Vietnamese delegation to the Geneva Conference

secretly passes the U.S. delegate a note of protest

which had been handed to the French. The note complains

that the "National Government of Vietnam has been left

in complete ignorance” of proposals made by the French

de facto partition proposal, a cease-fire, and requests

that United Nations control be established over all
