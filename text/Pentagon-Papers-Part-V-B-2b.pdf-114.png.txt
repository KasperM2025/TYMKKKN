strategic assessment of Southeast Asia, including Indochina:

"h, The mainland states of Southeast Asia also are at
present of critical strategic importance to the United States
because:

a. They are the major sources of certain strategic
materials required for the completion of United States
stock pile projects;

b. The area is a crossroad of commmications;

c. Southeast Asia is a vital segment in the line
of containment of communism stretching from Japan southward ~
and around to the Indian Peninsula, The security of
the three major non-Communist base areas in this quazter

Jarge measure on the denial of Southeast Asia to the Com-
munists. If Southeast Asia is lost, these three base areas
will tend to be isolated from one another;

a, The fall of Indochina would un√©oubtably lead to
the fall of the other metniland states of Southeast Asia,
Their fall would: :

(1) Requrie changing the Philippines and

Indonesia from supporting positions in the Asian

offshore island chain to front-line bases for the
