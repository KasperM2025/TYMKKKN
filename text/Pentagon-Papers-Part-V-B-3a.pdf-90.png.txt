At State-JCS meeting April 24 J€S in informal discussion mado
it clear they attach great weight to reservations they have made ao
to feasibilitv and nrospects of success of military plan for Indo~
China presented by French in Washington, It is apparent Chiefs feel
that plan might be "workable! but only if French pursue course of
action which would in effect remove basis for JCS reservations. JCS
described this course of action es including such things as appoint-—
ment bold and aggressive French military leader to Indcfhina Command,
revision French strategy in direction more immediate and telling
offensive action, use Vietnamese forces in lerge rather than small
units etc.

' JCS informally stated belief it was imperative US should force-
fully present such ideps to French and that unless French would
follow such advice it was possible US aid to French for Indo-China
would in fact be wasted,

JCS felt US Government vosition could only be develoved after
Secretary's return from YTATO meeting and that vromotly thereefter 1t
might be wise have joint militery and voliticel discussions with
French in Paris,

Above JCS views suggest caution in indicating to French now that
US apnroves French militery plan,
