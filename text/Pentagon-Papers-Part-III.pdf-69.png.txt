of General Navarre, who was asked several questions by the French dele-

tary situation on the French negotiatory position. Navarre's responses
were sent April 21. On the demarcation line, Navarre said that the
18th parallel would leave "us" the ancient political capitol of Hue
and Tourane (Da Nang), and. permit the retention of militarily valuable
terrain. See General Ely's Memoires: 1'Indochina dans la Tourmente
(Paris: Plan, 1964), p. 112, and Lacouture and Devillers, p. 126.
