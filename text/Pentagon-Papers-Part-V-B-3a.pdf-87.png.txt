It is not easy, but before the U.S., can give any

' commitment even as far as the Executive is concerned,

-we would like to feel that we have answers, or at least
observations a) allowing us to picture our help honorably
and fairly as not merely economic aid but as aid which
has a particular purpose, and b) constituting a program

the Pentagon to explain the program and the conditions
for its realization. He had said at that time that
one cannot seriously doubt -- even though it is being
done -- the will of France as regards the freedom of
Vietnam and the constitution of national armies since
they had been doing it for three years. The plan has
