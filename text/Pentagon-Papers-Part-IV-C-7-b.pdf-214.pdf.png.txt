The principle issue addressed in this re-evaluation was the level

of forces to be sent to Vietnam to meet MACV requirements for
augmentation resulting from TET. As such, the bulk of the papers
drafted and considered in the Clifford Group dealt only tangentially
with the air war. Since the problem of force deployments is treated
in Task Force paper IV.C.6, no attempt will be made here to furnish

tthe details of those papers. Only the sections dealing directly

with the air war will be treated. The broad outline of the policy
process, however, will be sketched to place the arguments about
bombing policy into perspective.

Handwritten notes by Morton Halperin from conversation with
Paul Warnke. (TS-EYES ONLY), no date.
