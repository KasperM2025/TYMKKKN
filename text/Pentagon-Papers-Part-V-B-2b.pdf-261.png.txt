following therefor:
"In the event of the imminent or actual fall of
| Malaya to communism, consider in the light of circum-
stances existing at the time, what if any measures, in-

interest should undertake to prevent the fall in
‘Indonesia to ccnmemtenta
REASON: It would be neither sound nor realistic
for the National Security Council to attempt to determine now
the course of action which would be undertaken in Indonesia
and in the Southwest Pacific if Malaya should fall to the
enemy; rather, the course of events globally and in
Southeast Asia must be re~exemined at that time in order to
arrive at any valid decision,
