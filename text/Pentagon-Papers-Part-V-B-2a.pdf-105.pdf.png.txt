CONFIDENTIAL

French here give impression they would not object to referendum in
Cochin Chiaa. Tlowever, they indicate they would not care to allow:
eomplete freedom: for Viet Nam agents there. Their objection is that
such agents would resort to terrorism to influence vote. (There seen:
to be certain amount of justification for French contention. Viet Nam
police have been treating pro-French Viet Namese and Metis with
French nationality rather severely in Tonkin.)

Outcome of any referendum would probably be largely determined
by conditions under which it would be held. French feel Cochin
China would vote 80% for autonomy. Viet Nam claim Cochin China
would vote 80% for incorporation with Viet Nam. Both claim[s]
have an unspoken promise [prem/se7] that claimant could establish
conditions of referendum, Neutral observers here feel vote in referen-
dum free of undue influence from either side would be close.
