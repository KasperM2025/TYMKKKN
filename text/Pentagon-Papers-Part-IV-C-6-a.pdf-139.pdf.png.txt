+. As indicated in the VC/NVA losses table, enemy losses increased by
115 per week during a period in which friendly strength increased by
166,000; an increase of about 70 losses per 100,000 of friendly strength.
There are far too many uncertain variables in the situation to permit a
simple extrapolation of these results to the effect of introduction of
the next 100,000, or a subsequent 1C0,000 troops. However, we have no
evidence that more troops than the 470,000 I am recommending would sub-
stantially change the situation. For example, if it were assumed that
new forces would produce enemy losses at a rate equal to the average of
all forces deployed by the end of October 1966, each deployment of 100,000
additional friendly troops would produce only 230 more total enemy losses
per week compared to the 2915 current enemy input rate. A U.S. force of
470,000 would result in enemy losses of 2450 per week; an extra 100,000
U.S. personnel would increase average weekly enemy losses to about 2680,
still less than the 3500 per week that the enemy is supposed to be able
to infiltrate/recruit. Moreover, it is possible that our attrition es-
timates substantially overstate actual VC/NVA losses. For example, the
vc/NVA apparently lose only about one-sixth as many weapons as people,
suggesting the possibility that many of the killed are unarmed porters or
bystanders.
