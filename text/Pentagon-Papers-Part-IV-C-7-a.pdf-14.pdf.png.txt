McNamara memo to Lt Gen

JcsM 646-66

McNamara trip to Vietnam

McNamara requests the views
of the Chiefs on the proposed
barrier.

RT is redirected from a
primary POL emphasis to “attri-
tion of men, supplies, equip-
ment...."

General Wheeler agrees to the
creation of a special project
for the barrier under General
Starbird, but expresses con-
cern that funding of the program
not be at the expense of other
activities.

The intelligence community turns
in an overwhelmingly negative
appraisal of the effect of FOL
attacks. No POL shortages are
evident, and in general the
bombing has not created insur-
mountable transportation diffi-
culties, economic dislocations,
or weakening of popular morale.

CINCPAC ridicules the idea of
a barrier.

Starbird is designated as the
head of a Joint Task Force for‘
the barrier.

In @ report on the US world-
wide force posture the Chiefs
express grave concern at the
thinness with which manpower is
stretched. They recommend
mobilization of the reserves.

McNamara, Katzenbach, Wheel=r,
Komer, McNaughton and others
spend three days in Vietnam on
a Presidential fact-finder.
