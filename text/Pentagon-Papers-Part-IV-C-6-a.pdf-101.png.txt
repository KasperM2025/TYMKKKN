AND CONTINUING PORT CONGESTION, IT 1S DOUBTFUL THAT IMPORTS WILL
REACH THE ASSUMED LEVEL OF $725 MILLION DURING 1957. TO THE
EXTENT THEY 00 NOT_ANO CUSTOMS COLLECTION SRE LESS THAN
PLANNED, WE WILL BE FACED WITH A LARGER GAP AND HENCE MORE
INFLATIGH THAN WE NOY ANTICIPATE IN OUR PLANNING FIGURES.
Fe KEY ASSUMPTIONS
18. BASED ON THE ABOVE THINKING, WE MADE AS STRINGENT A
BUDGET PLAN AS WE COULD, CONSISTENT WITH OUR OTHER MILITARY
AND CIVILIAN OBJECTIVES. QUR PROPOSED BUDGET PLAN IS BASED
ON THE FOLLOYING ASSUMPTIONS.
A. VIETNAMESE ARMED FORCES ARE ASSUMED TO HOLD DURING 196
AT A FORCE LEVEL EQUAL TO THAT REACHED AT THE END OF OCTOBER
1966. 1 FEEL THAT GIVEN OUR INFLATIONARY SITUATION, IT IS
IMPERATIVE THAT THE VIETNAMESE MILITARY NOT PLACE FURTHER
DRAINS ON THE LIMITEO MANPOZER RESOURCES IN THIS
COUNTRY. THESE DRAINS HAVE HAD A WEAKENING EFFECT ON THE
ABILITY OF THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT TO PERFORM. WITH THE
IMPROVEMENT IN OUR MILITARY POSITION DURING 1966, IT SEEMS
DESIRABLE TO nev RATE IN 1967 ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY
OF THE VN ARMED FORCES RATHER THAN EXPANDING THEM IN SIZe.
B) YE HAVE ASSUNED A YAGE INCREASE BY THE GYN OF ONLY
19 PER CENT. CLEARLY THIS IS THE MINIMUM ‘YAGE INCREASE
THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTASLE
© WE HAVE HELD BOTH THE CIVIL ANO THE MILITARY GVN BUDGETS
TO BARE~BONES LEVELS.
D) WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE MILITARY WILL MAINTAIN THEIR
PIASTER EXPENDITURES THROUGHOUT CALENDAR YEAR 1957 AT THE
42 BILLION PIASTER LEVEL. THIS IS A CRITICAL ASSUMPTION AND
IS BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SECRETARY MCNAMARA HAS
ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO HOLD U.S. MILITARY PIASTER SPENDING
TO WITHIN 36 BILLION PIASTERS DURING THIS FISCAL YEAR. AOMIT~
TEDLY, THIS WILL MEAN A FURTHER STRETCHOUT OF CONSTRUCTION
PROGRAMS , ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO REDUCE PERSONAL EXPENDITURES
BY U.S. TROOPS, .AND POSSIBLY THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL U.S.
SUPPORT TROOPS. IF THIS BUDGET LEVEL CANNOT BE HELD, IT WILL
JEOPARDIZE OUR ENTIRE ANTI =INFLATIONARY PROGRAM HERE IN
VIET-NAM. | AM MOST APPRECIATIVE OF THE UNDERSTANDING ANO
EXCELLENT COOPERATION WHICH SECRETARY MCNAMARA HAS GIVEN TO US
ON THIS SUBJECT.
E) ME HAVE CUT THE USAID/GYN PROGRAMS BY ONE-THIRD,
BRINGING THEM DOWN FROM THE 43 SHICH WAS REQUESTED TO 19
BILLION PIASTERS. 1 WAS HOST RELUCTANT TO MAKE A CUT OF SUCH
PROPORTIONS IN THIS VITAL AREA, BUT FEEL THAT SE CANNOT MEET
OUR STABILIZATION OBJECTIVES UNLESS BOTH THE CIVILIAN ANO
MILITARY PROGRAMS ARE CUT. CUTTING ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER
NEITHER SERVES OUR INTERESTS NOR ALLOWS US TO MEET OUR
OBJECTIVES. FURTHERMORE, IT SEEMS TO ME DESIRABLE ON THE
CIVILIAN SIDE, TO CONCENTRATE ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF
PROGRAMS AS ELL AS EXPANDING THEM. LODGE
