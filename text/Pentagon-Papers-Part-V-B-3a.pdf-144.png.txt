26. The primary deficiencies in the development of indigenous
armies lies in the training of leaders, staff officers and, in a lesser
degree, specialists (see Annex "K", Training and Schools in Indochina).
The "Letourneau Plan" calls for the augnentation of an organization

already overwhelmingly preponderant in independent battalions by acti-

_vating a large number of additional battalions. The ‘Navarre Plan will
“ Wpuild up progressively a battle corps by grouping battalions into

~~ regiments and regiments into divisions and by giving units thus created

the necessary support (artiiiery. engineers, armor, communications)
taking into account the very special sharacter of the war in Indochina",
Organization of yeamiee forces along these lines will begin immediately
(see Annex "I", Reorgenization of French Union Forces). Commando

bat ealions will initially be employed as independent orgenizations in

the pacification program wherein they will get some battle indoctrination
and organized into regiments and divisions at a later date. General
Navarre stated that he proposed to keep these battalions on pacification
duty 3 or 4 months.

27. Taking into account the current and planned developiment of
Associated States Military Forces, there is no deficit of force in
Indochina. The new command in Indochina will, in my opinion, accomplish
the decisive defeat of the Viet Minh by 1955. The addition of 2 or more
French divisions from outside Indochina would expedite the defeat of the
Viet Minh. Greatly increased participation of China in the war in Indo-

china would require a reappraisal.
