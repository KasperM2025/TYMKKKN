F. Phase ITA is Revised
1. CINCPAC's Requirements

: The results of the review were forwarded to the Secretary of
Defense on 16 December. CINCPAC's new requirements were summarized by
ASD Enthoven as follows:

The CINCPAG request involves a deployment to RVN of
43,000 personnel by December 1966, vice 368,000 in the
December plan...In addition he wants to increase Thailand
strength from the approved December 1966 total of 26,800
to 57,100 of which 33,000 is available. While CINCPAC
still wants 75 US maneuver battalions by December, his re-
quest involves an earlier deployment, approximately 711
battalion months in CY 1966 vs 654 in the December plan or
693 Service capability.

The increase and acceleration of Combat Support Batta-
lions is more serious, involving over 82 battalions as com-
pared with less than 60 in the December plan; 13 battalions
of this increase are HAWK and Air Defense guns, neither of
which are readily available. Similarly CINCPAC wants over
68 battalions of engineers by December, 22 more than in the
Decenber plan, and similarly unavailable.

The helicopter problem would be further compounded by
the CINCPAC request for 2,88 by December versus 2,391 in
the December plan and 2,240 said to be available by the
Services.... 42

With the revised CINCPAC requirements in hand, the services began
to estimate their capability of meeting them. This exercise surfaced
the problem of assumptions to be made about sources of manpower avail-
able to meet the requirements.

2. Assumptions for Planning
These assumptions were grouped into three sets or cases:

CASE 1: Meeting these requirements by providing forces
from CONUS current force structure including
activations, plus feasible draw-downs from over-
seas areas, call-up of selected reserve units
and individuals, and extending terms of service.

CASE 2: Meeting these requirements by providing forces
from CONUS current force structure including
activations, plus feasible draw-downs from
overseas areas.
