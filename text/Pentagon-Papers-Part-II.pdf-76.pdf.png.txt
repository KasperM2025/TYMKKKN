b. Rejection of Unilateral Intervention

Thus, as the curtain began to fall on the French effort
at Dien Bien Phu, and the question of what the U.S. would do became
eritical, the U.S. Government backed away from unilateral intervention.
The Defense Department was reluctant to intervene following the Army's
presentation of the view that air-naval action alone would not do the job
and ground forces would be needed. The very recent experience of the
Korean War mitigated strongly against another American involvement in an
Asian land war. Furthermore, the President was not willing to enter into
such a venture unless it was cloaked with Congressional approval. Such
approval, in turn, depended upon the participation of the allies. Hence,
â€˜Secretary Dulles undertook the task of persuading Britain, France and
the Asian allies to participate in a coalition for "united action" in
Indochina.
