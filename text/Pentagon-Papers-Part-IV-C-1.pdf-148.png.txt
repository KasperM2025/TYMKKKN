sharp debate within the GVN. Something of this sort was needed before
taking up the matter of troop arrangements with Quat. 152.

Later the same day, Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson sent Wash-
ington his personal observations on the recent decision to introduce
third country troops, He had just returned from one day at Pleiku with
Premier Quat, and two days in the Danang-Hue area, where he had had "exe
tended visits and informal conversations with all of the senior Marine
officers ashore,"

I fully appreciate considerations both internal and external
to SVN which impel move on our part to bring this war to success ~
ful conclusion as quickly as possible...However, I gravely question |
whether this result can be achieved at this time by massive input
of non~Vietnamese military forces, As we have learned, we are
â€œdealing with volatile and hyper-sensitive people with strong zeno-
phobie characteristics never far below the surface, We have thus
far deployed our Marine battalions to minimize direct contact with
local population, This not only from our choice but that of GVN,
especially General Thi, On this I think Thi is right. Hasty and
ill conceived deployment of non-Vietnamese in combat roles where
they are substantially involved with local population could
badly backfire on U.S, and give rise to cries by Buddhists...and
others to 'throw out foreigners' and 'return Vietnam to the
Vietnamese,.,!

The message went on to Say that in the next few weeks the Marines at Danang |
would have a chance to test their success as a reaction force in Support of
ARVN initiated contact with the enemy, and in patrolling thinly populated
areas, The Deputy Ambassador recommended that we await the outcome of

this testing before engaging any more forces, 153/ =

A hastily arranged meeting in Honolulu on 20 April was evidently
called to soothe Taylor's temper over the hasty decisions to deploy third
country troops, and to get agreement to them by the senior U.S. policy
officials concerned -- not to reverse or alter those policies or to shift
the direction of our commitments, By that point we were inexorably com-
mitted to a military resolution of the insurgency. The problem seemed
no longer soluble by any other means, :
