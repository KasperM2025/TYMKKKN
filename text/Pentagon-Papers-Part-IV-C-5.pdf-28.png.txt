after occupying and in-
proving then.

Westmoreland recommended locations for
various forces then being discussed for
future deployment:

III MEF - Da Nang, Hue, Chu Lai

Airmobile Division - Qui Nhon, Nha Trang

ROK Division - Quang Ngai, Chu Iai (relieve USMC)
173d - Bien Hoa/Vung Tau (already landing)

Taylor described arrival of 173d and Marines;
predicted boredom would be a problem.

JCS told CINCPAC that SecDef approved
combined coordinating staff with RVINAF
and knew that MACV was planning a Joint
General Staff.

Westmoreland told DA he was preparing
concept for employment of a division-sized
force, possibly the airmobile division,
and requested experts to help plan.

Taylor told State Quat was agreeable to
deployment of an Army brigade to Qui Nhon/
Nha Trang. If build-up of Cam Ranh Bay

as a base were to be approved, he said,
Westmoreland wanted to divert one battalion
there for security.

Taylor told State that RVN could absorb
0,000 US/3d country troops. He recommended
a pause before considering further expansion
and wanted to hold off logistics support for
contingency follow-on until there was a case
of clear and indisputable necessity.

JCS recommended to SecDef that Cam Ranh Appr.
Bay be developed to either (1) enable by
further contingency deployments, or (2)â€™ SecDef
to fully support troops already there. 8 Jun
