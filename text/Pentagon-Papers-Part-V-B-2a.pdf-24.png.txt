statement of U.S. policy on Indochina to the NSC for con-
sideration. "The U.S. will not commit any of its armed

‘forces to the defense of Indochina against overt, foreign

ageression...." but should assist in the "formation of

new national armies of the three Associeted States." The

U.S. should also "press the French” to carry out the

agreements of 8 March 1949 and 30 December 1949. SEAC

“The draft statement of U.S. policy in Indochine is weak

from the political side....the Defense representatives

ergued for 2 strong, hardhitting policy on political and

economic concessions. The State Department representatives

flatly refused....to consider Indochina in thet mormer.
Consequently, the paner ended with a compromise.” K. 7,
