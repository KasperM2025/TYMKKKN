In this, general discussion of our foreign nolicy, I
must make special ention of the war in Korea.

This war is, for jimericans, the most painful phase
of Communist aggression throughout the world. It is clearly
a part of the sane calculated assault that the aggressor
is sinultaneously pressing in Indochina and in Malaya,
and of the strategic situation that senifestly embraces
the island of Fornosa and the Chinese Nationalist forces
there. The working out of any ilitary solution to the
orean War will inevitably affect all these areas.
