SECURITY INFORMATION

coneept should be based on needs of the French Union Forces
+n Indochina for additional equipment necessary to implement
the organization of the 'Battle Corps‚Äù envisaxed by the
Navarre concept and necessary support of the planned expan-
sion of indigenous forces, such needs to be screened by the
Military Assistance Advisory Group in Indochina. In addi-
tion, to improve the chances of success, this support should
include continued close liaison and coordination with French
military authorities together with friendly but firm encourage-
ment and advice where indicated, ;

4. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the
necessary support should be provided to permit full and vigorous
implementation of the Navarre concept, conditioned upon con-
tinued implementation of French support, demonstration of
French intent by actual performance in Indochina, and continued
French willingness to receive and act upon U.S. military advice.
Further, the French should be urged at all levels to support
and vigorously prosecute the Navarre concept to the maximum
extent of their capabilities.

For the Joint Chiefs of Staff:
