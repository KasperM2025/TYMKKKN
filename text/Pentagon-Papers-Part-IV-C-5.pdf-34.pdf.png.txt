Deptel 3057 W. Bundy told Taylor that
Westmoreland could commit
U.S. troops to combat "in any
situation in which the use of
such troops is required by an
appropriate GVN commander and
when, in COMUSMACV's judgment,
their use is necessary to
strengthen the relative posi-
tion of GVN forces."

ISA Memo of On 25 June Alexis Johnson told
Conversation McNaughton that in many respects
w/Dep Amb. the situation in SVN was no worse

than the previous year. Even if
it were, large numbers of foreign
troops could do no more than hold
@ few enclaves. The Vietnamese
feared massive inputs of foreign
troops would degrade their control
over the country.

Memo for Ball of State described the Vietnam
The war as one the U.S. cannot win re-
President - gardless of effort. Rather than

have the U.S. pour its resources

down the drain in the wrong place,

he recommended that U.S. force
levels be held to 15 battalions
and 72,000 men announced by SecDef
in June. The combat role of the
U.S. forces should be restricted
to base security and reserve in
support of ARVN. As rapidly as
possible and in full realization
of the diplomatic losses which
might be incurred, the U.S. should
exit from Vietnam and thereby cut
its losses.

Memo for W. Bundy of State proposed a
The "middle way‚Äù to the President
President which would avoid the ultimatum

aspects of the 44 battalions
request and also the Ball with-
drawal proposal, both of which
Were undesirable. Bundy offered
further experimentation with U.S.
troops from coastal enclaves.
