"intelligence gaps" related to kinds
and amounts of arms, supplies and
men infiltrating SVN through Laos,
The JCS favored closing such gaps
by overt military operations; State
opposed.

1 Mar 64 Interim Report: An Interagency Study Group under
"Alternatives for State's Vietnam Committee listed
the Imposition of these as U.S, objectives: make
Measured Pressure Hanoi cease support of the Viet
against NVN" Cong; strengthen GVN and Asian

morale and reduce VC morale; prove
to the world U.S. determination
to oppose Communist expansion.

Military means to attain those ob-.
jectives were explored -- ranging
from the air defense of Saigon

and US/GVN cross-border operations
to the massive deployment of U.S.
ground troops and air strikes
against North Vietnam. The group
believed unilateral U.S. actions
would not compel Hanoi to call off
the Viet Cong (and doubted Hanoi
could do that anyway); operations
against NVN were termed no substi-
tute for successful coumterinsur-
gency in SVN.

However, expanded activity could
demonstrate U.S, power, determi-
nation and restraint to the world,
reduce somewhat NVN support to the
Viet Cong, cause â€œsome reduction"
Viet Cong morale, and possibly .-
improve the U.S. negotiating
position. "New U.S. bolstering
actions" in South Vietnam and
considerable improvement of the
situation there were required to
reduce VC activity and make victory
on the ground possible, according
to the report.
