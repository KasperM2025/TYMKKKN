areas of our country to the communists, These divisions
should be mobilized and equipped, together with initial
logistic support units, immediately after completion of
activation of the presently contemplated increase of 20,000 ,
which you have offered to support.

Following the activation of these units, which should begin
in about five months, we must carry on the program of acti-
vation of additional units until over a period of two years
we will have achieved a force of 14 infantry divisions, an
expanded airborne brigade of approximately division

strength and accompanying (support?)... The mission of this
total 270,000 man force remains the same, namely, to over-
come the insurgency which has risen to the scale of a bloody,
communist-inspired civil war within our borders and to pro-
vide initial resistance to overt, external aggression until
free world forces under the SEATO agreement can come to our
aid, The question naturally arises as to how long we shall
have to carry the burden of so sizeable a military force.
Unfortunately, I can see no early prospects for the reduction
of such a force once it has been established; for even though
we may be successful in liquidating the insurgency within our
borders, communist pressure in Southeast Asia and the external
military threat to our country must be expected to increase, a:
fear, before it diminishes. This means that we must be pre-
pared to maintain a strong defensive military posture for at
least the foreseeable future in order that we may not become
one of the so-called "soft spots" which traditionally have
attracted communist aggression. We shall therefore continue
to need material support to maintain this force whose re-
quirements far exceed the capacity of our economy to

To accomplish this 100,000 man expansion of our military
forces, which is perfectly feasible from a manpower viewpoint,
will require a great intensification of our training pro-
grams in order to produce, in the minimum of time, those
qualified combat leaders and technical specialists needed to
fill the new units and to provide to them the technical and
logistic support required to insure their complete effective-
ness, For this purpose a considerable expansion of the
United States Military Advisory Group is an essential require-
ment, Such an expansion, in the form of selected elements of
the American Armed Forces to establish training centers for
the Vietnamese Armed Forces, would serve the dual purpose of
providing an expression of the United Statesâ€™ determination to
halt the tide of communist aggression and of preparing our
forces in the minimum of time.

While the Government and people of Vietnam are prepared to
carry the heavy manpower burden required to save our country,
