LITERALLY EYES ONLY FOR UNDER SECRETARY FROM AMBASSADOR
REF: STATE 12243

1. BEFORE ADDRESSING SPECIFIC ACTION ALTERNATIVES I SUBMIT FOLLOWING
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL. MUCH WOULD DEPEND UPON
GENERAL SETTING IN WHICH GIVEN ACTION TOOK PLACE, IF ANY OF THEM
COME-OUT OF THE BLUE OR IN SITUATION WHICH APPEARED TO REFLECT U.S.
DECISION TO ACHIEVE CLEAR MILITARY VICTORY, SOVIET REACTION WOULD

BE FAR STRONGER THAN IF IT APPEARED TO BE EFFORT TO OFFSET MILITARY
REVERSES. IMPORTANT ALSO WOULD BE CURRENT WEIGHT OF OPINION IN

POLITBURO BETWEEN HAWKS AND DOVES OF WHICH WE KNOW LITTLE. HOWEVER,
SOVIET FRUSTRATIONS AT BUDAPEST CONFERENCE, PROBABLE EFFECT ON
SOVIET LEADERSHIP OF THEIR OWN PROPAGANDA WHICH HAS BEEN INCREASING
TN STRIDENCY RECENTLY AND WHICH HAS TENDED TO STRENGTHEN SOVIET
COMMITMENT NOT ONLY TO NVN BUT ALSO TO NLF, AND EFFECT ON LEADERSHIP
OF OTHER PROBLEMS SUCH AS MIDDLE EAST AND KOREA, ALL, IT SEEMS TO
ME, HAVE OPERATED TO MAKE SOVIET REACTIONS MORE LIKELY TO BE VIGOROUS
THAN WAS THE CASE A YEAR AGO.

2, I? SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT SOVIET REACTIONS WOULD NOT
NECESSARILY BE CONFINED TO VIETNAM. THEY COULD INCREASE TENSION
TN GERMANY, PARTICULARLY IN BERLIN, IN KOREA AND MIDDLE EAST.
THEY COULD REVERT TO ALL-OUT COLD WAR AND IN ANY EVENT WOULD STEP
UP DIPLOMATIC AND PROPAGANDA ACTIVITY.

3, IN ALL OF ALTERNATIVES MENTIONED I WOULD EXPECT INCREASED
