3. Common Leadership. North and South Vietnam have shared
leaders throughout the last three decades, a commonality which has
lately developed into Northerners holding the top posts both within the
GVN and within the NLF. Tran Van Gian, an old ICP leader, headed the
"front" government in Saigon in 1945, and then returned to Hanoi to
hold high DRV posts. His successor was Nguyen Phuong Thao (alias
Nguyen Binh), a northerner, who led the Southern Resistance through 1951,
and subsequently died in the North. 126/ Nguyen Phuong Thao (alias
Nguyen Binh) was succeeded by Ie Duan, who became First Secretary of
the Lao Dong Party openly in 1960, and probably de facto in 195/.

Ie Duan's deputy was Le Duc Tho, in 1960 director of the Organizational
Department of the lao Dong Party, and a member of its Central Committee.
Pham Hung, in 1960 a member of the Lao Dong Secretariat and a Deputy
Premier of the DRV, and Ung Van Khiem, in 1960 on the lao Dong Central
oe were also among the leaders of the Southern Viet Minh through
1954.

Ile Duan remained in the South after Geneva, or at least is
mentioned in intelligence reports as being in the South frequently
through 1957. 127/ His return to North Vietnam in mid-1957 precipitated,
according to some sources, a struggle among Ho's lieutenants between a
moderate faction opposing DRV support of guerrilla war in the South, and
a militant faction led by Le Duan. 128/ He is also reported to have been
sent on an inspection trip to the South in 1958, and in early 1959, to
have presented a series of recommendations for immediate action in the
South to the Lao Dong Central Committee. 129/ General Van Tien Dung,
Chief of Staff of the NVA and alternate Politburo member, was reportedly
a member of the Party's southern: apparatus from mid-1955 through 1956,
having been sent south to contract alliances with Hoa Hao and Cao Dai
armed bands; Nguyen Van Vinh, one of his deputies, also served there at
the same time. 130/ Intelligence is vague on Le Duan's replacement in
1957. However, among those northern leaders mentioned by intelligence
sources as serving in the South in the period after 1956 are Tran Van
Tra, Le Duan's pre-1954 military adviser in the South, and now 4 NVA
deputy chief of staff; and Muoi Cuc (Neuyen Van Cuc), one of Le Duan's
close followers. 131/

Both the infiltrated regroupees and the relatively few
northerners who accompanied them in the years 1959-1963 were lower-level
leaders. As George Carver put it:

"They were not foot soldiers or cannon fodder (at least
not until Hanoi began sending in whole North Vietnamese
units in late 1964 or early 1965). Instead they were
disciplined, trained and indoctrinated cadres and technicians.
They became the squad leaders, platoon leaders, political officers,
staff officers, unit commanders, weapons and communications
specialists who built the Viet Cong's military force into what
it is today. They also became the village, district, provincial
and regional committee chiefs and key committee members who
