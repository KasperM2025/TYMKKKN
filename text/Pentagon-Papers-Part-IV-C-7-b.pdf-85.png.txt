Secretary of Defense proposal was made, but it is clear what the
decision was. It was to adopt alternativeq--i.e., push onward with
the bombing program essentially as it had been, continuing the bit-
by-bit expansion of armed reconnaissance and striking a few new fixed
targets in each ROLLING THUNDER series, but still holding back from
closing the ports and such sensitive targets as the MIG airfields.

The next ROLLING THUNDER series, No. 57, was authorized
on 20 July. Sixteen fixed targets were selected, including one air-
field, one rail yard, two bridges, and 12 barracks and supply areas, all
within the Hanoi and Haiphong circles but not within the forbidden 10-
mile inner circle around the center of Hanoi against which Admiral Sharp
had sailed. Armed reconnaissance was expanded along 23 road, rail, and
waterway segments between the 30-mile and the 10-mile circles around

Hanoi. 179/

For the moment at least neither the hawks nor the doves
had won their case. The President had decided merely to extend ROLLING
THUNDER within the general outlines already established. In effect, the
RT 57 was a decision to postpone the issue, insuring that the partisans
would continue their fight. As for the President, he would not move
decisively until the next year when outside events were heavily forcing
his hand and a new Secretary of Defense had entered the debate.
