C.f., informal memorandum from Mr. Max Lehrer to General Bonesteel of
April 21, 1954: "This /attached/ report makes it clear that the U.S.
MAAG has little information available on which it could operate. The
written report actually understates the deficiencies in information.
Our people find that the morale of the MAAG in Indochina is virtually .
non-existent and the MAAG is reduced to relative impotence.”

Regarding the Letourneau-Allard plan, General Trapnell, Chief MAAG,
reported, "while this plan is slow and expensive, the other course
of action is to accept a stalemate which is also not only expensive,
but in the long run, favors the Viet Minh and offers no solution."
(Memorandum from General Trapnell, OSD files, March 31, 1953)

Although General O'Daniel, in his report of July 15, 1953 (TS) waxed
enthusiastic over the successor Navarre Plan, broadly and attractively
described to him by General Navarre himself, it was clear to others
that the plan was hollow. "There is no concrete evidence that the
French Union forces will be able to take decisive action to win the
war in the foreseeable future..." (Comments by Army Attache, Saigon,
November 24, 1953 (S))
