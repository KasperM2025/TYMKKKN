may now have to help themselves in this fight. Similerly, it would be

*

a further sign to the South Vietnamese leaders that we will carry an

2) io prevent & military defeat in South Vietnan. if do not
think there is danger of any significant military defeat, given the

3) To prevent terrorism. Though there is terrorism in
South Vietnem now, I doubt that additional U.S. combat forces would
significantly reduce it. Tnis is 2 job for police-type forces, not

3,265 waich the DIA/UST2 estimate they can swallow inde
