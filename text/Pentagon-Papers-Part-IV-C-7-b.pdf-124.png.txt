d. DRV Constraints. These considerations
probably would continue to constrain DRV's choices among
options at cessation:

(1) Strategy of protracted war. The
DRV would probably continue to put at risk in SVN only
those minimum forces it considers necessary to prosecute
its strategy of protracted war.

(2) Fear of US invasion.

(3) Desire to preserve appearance of
VC primacy in SVN.

(4) Limitations on ability to trans-
fer trained personnel and leadership to SVN because of
possibility of US resumption of attacks on NVN.

(5) DRV may be miscaleulating the
progress of the war in SVN. 50/

7. For US: Potential Risk

a.) â€œ20: Operations in SVN. The most far-

reaching risk is an increase in enemy combat strength that
may well go undetected by the US/RVN/FWMAF. Additionally,
the US position could be disadvantaged by:

(1) Movements of heavy artillery and AAA.
(2) Loss of US supporting fire at DMZ.

(3) Increased threat from DMZ and border
area.

(4) Impairment of pacification program.
(5) Lowering of morale of US/RVN/FWMAF.
