T had better not describe how we would handle it
put it would be one whale of a big attack....this might
well trigger, in the view of some, would trigger Chinese
intervention on the ground....This is what we wish to
avoid. 2h/

Before the House Committee on Armed Services two days later,
Secretary McNamara stressed both the irrelevance of targets like the
POL facilities at Haiphong to infiltration into the South and the risks
of Chinese intervention:

At present our bombing program against the North is
directed primarily against the military targets that are
associated with the infiltration of men and equipment into
the South, ammo depots, supply depots, barracks areas, the
particular lines of communication over which these move
into the South. For that reason, we have not struck in
the Hanoi area because the targets are not as directly
related to the infiltration of men and equipment as those
outside the area....As to the Haiphong POL....if we
strike that there will be greater pressure on Communist
China to undertake military action in support of the
North Vietnamese....We want to avoid that if we possibly
can. 25/

On other occasions the Secretary put such stress on the limitea
interdiction purposes of the bombing that it seemed to virtually rule out
altogether industrial and other "strategic" targets:

--ewe are seeking by our bombing in North Vietnam
to reduce and make more costly the movement of men and
supplies from North Vietnam into South Vietnam for the
support of the Viet Cong operations in South Vietnam.
That's our primary military objective, and that requires
that we bomb the lines of communication primarily and
secondarily, the ammunition and supply depots....The great
bulk of our bombing...is directed against traffic moving on
roads and railroads, and the other portion...is directed
against specific targets associated with the lines of com-
munication, primarily supply depots and...bridges....We
think our,bombing policy is quite properly associated with
the effort to stop the insurgency in South Vietnam. We've
said time after time: It is not our objective to destroy
the Government of North Vietnam. We're not seeking to
widen the war. We do have a limited objective, and that's
why our targeting is limited as eG ees
