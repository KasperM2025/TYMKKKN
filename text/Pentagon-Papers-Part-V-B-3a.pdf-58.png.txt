The Counter Insurgency Plan (CIP) for South Vietnam is sub-

mitted for approyal to Washington. MAAG prepared most of

the CIP which is based on State and DOD guidance. Some of

the recommendations set forth have already been communi-

cated to GVN. The Country Team is not unanimous, however,

on the recommended 20,000-man increase in RVNAF -- Durbrow
maintains reservations. The CIP, which is an enclosure to

Tele 276, is not reproduced here. Saigon 276 to State,

President Eisenhower meets with President-elect John F.

Kennedy on the subject of Laos. Attendees are Dean Rusk,

Robert McNamara, Douglas Dillon, and Clark M. Clifford.

Eisenhower gives the impression that if Laos applies for

SEATO aid, the obligation of the U.S. and other signa-

tories is binding. Eisenhower says that "Laos is the key

to the entire area of Southeast Asia" -- if Laos falls,

then all the area is written off. Kennedy asks "how long

it would take to put a U.S. division into Laos.” Memoran-
