See Dulles' September 2, 1953, address to the American Legion, in
which he said: "We want peace in Indochina, as well as in Korea.
The political conference about to be held relates in the first
instance to Korea. But growing out of that conference could come,
if Red China wants it, an end of aggression and restoration of peace
in Indochina. The United States would welcome such a development.‚Äù

Cf. a French memorandum, undated, following tripartite (U.S.-U.K.-

France) talks in Washington in July 1953. Here, it is urged that
the Chinese representative to the Korean political conference

be sounded out on China's intentions toward Indochina. China must
be made to conclude "that her best interest is to cut down her
support of the Viet Minh, in order to enjoy the benefits which she

Inight expect to derive from a prolonged or final cessation of

hostilities on the 38th parallel." (CONFIDENTIAL).

Dulles reminded Ely that once the U.S. committed any of its armed
forces to the war, we would want to have a success, which in turn
meant: "a greater degree of partnership than had prevailed up to
present time, notably in relation to independence for Associated
States and training of indigenous forces." Dulles priority telegram
