2, Pending the outcome of the proposed discussions in Paris the
following procedure, which is in line with the known views of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff will be followed:

(a) While avoiding so far as practicable unnecessary or
long-term commitments with regard to the amount or character
of any assistance which the United States may give to the
French resistance forces in Indochina, this Government should
continue to afford such assistance as does not interfere with
the requirements of other planned operations. The French Pro-
visional Government should be informed confidentially that
owing to the need for concentrating all our resources in the
Pacific on operations already planned, large-scale military
operations aimed directly at the liberation of Indochina
cannot be contemplated at this time. American troops should
not be used in Indochina except in American military opera-
tions against the Japanese.

(b) Frenca offers of military and naval assistence in the
Pacific should be considered on their military merits as bear-
ing on the objective of defeating Japan as in the case of
British and Dutch proposals. There would be no objection to
furnishing of assistance to any French military or naval forces
so approved regardless of the theatre of operations from which
the assistance may be sent provided such assistance does not
involve a diversion of resources which the Combined or Joint
Chiefs of Staff consider are needed elsewhere.
