11. Mr. Acheson stated that his government at-
tached the greatest importance to the increase |
of military forces in Indo-China, including both
national and Freneh Union forces. The U.S. had
given substantial assistance in the past and was
prepared to increase this assistance. As to
financial aid, the United States would be able

to furnish items of military equipment manu-
factured in the United States, but could not supply
money to be used locally. Mr. Acheson stated

that the United States could not furnish the direct
tactical air support requested by M. Schuman.
Finally, the military discussions described in

Part B of Doc. 8 should take place soon in the

Far East and should involve military commanders

now engaged in operations in that area, to study,
among other things, measures to be taken.
