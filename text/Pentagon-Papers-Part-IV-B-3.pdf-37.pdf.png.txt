Amb. Komer complained that the
CORDS advisory element's actual
streneth was seriously below
authorization due to bureaucratic
delays.

Study of leverage by Hans
Heymann and Lt Col Volney Warner
recommended increased use.

Westmoreland disagreed with

Roles and Missions Study Group
recommendation to remove division
from chain of command below CTZ
level and strengthening role of
Province Chief.

JCS submitted final detailed
troop list for Program #5. Con-
tained 2,577 additional advisors
and 666 Special Forces to perfcrm
advisor-Like functions.

First published Review and
Analysis for RVNAF appeared:
long catalogue of RVNAF defic-
iencies.

Komer replied to recommendation
for increased use of U.S. leverage
that it must be done discreetly.
Proposed comprehensive system

of country-wide leverage was

never adopted.

JCS forwarded with endorsement
the MACV-CINCPAC recommendation
on FY 68 RVNAF force increases:
total increase of 63,586; 47,839
for RF/PF and 15,747 for regular
forces. MACV requested further
increase of 78,20) for FY 1969,

MeNemara approved the requestedg
Fy 68 augmentations for RVNAT,

against the wishes of Enthoven,
who would have authorized only

half as many.
