I. Introduction

MARINE COMBAT UNITS GO TO DA NANG -- MARCH 1965

At approximately nine o'clock on the morning of 8 March 1965, the
United States Marine Corps' Battalion Landing Team 3/9 splashed ashore
at Da Nang on the mainland of Southeast Asia. Although there were
already over 20,000 American servicemen in Vietnam, this was the first
time that U.S. ground combat units had been committed to action. The
mission assigned 3/9 and its companion battalion 1/3 (which landed by
air later the same day) was "to occupy and defend critical terrain
features in order to secure the airfield and, as directed, communica-
tions facilities, U.S. supporting installations, port facilities,
landing beaches and other U.S. installations against attack. The U.S.
Marine Force will not, repeat will not, engage in day to day actions
against the Viet Cong." i/ The overall responsibility for the security
of that base complex was to remain within the purview of the ARVN Com-
mander of the I Corps Tactical Zone, General Nguyen Chenh Thi. It was
hoped that with the provision of reinforcements for Da Nang security,
General Thi would be able to release some of his own troops from that
mission to undertake offensive action against the Viet Cong. 2/ In
light of subsequent events, it would be facile to conclude that the
modest input of some 3,500 Marines at this juncture presaged the massive
buildup of U.S. fighting power in Vietnam which brought American military
strength in country to over 180,000 by the end of 1965. Except for
COMUSMACY who did see it as a first step and welcomed it and Ambassador
Taylor who saw it as an unwelcome first step, official Washington re-
garded the deployment as a one shot affair to meet a specific situation.
