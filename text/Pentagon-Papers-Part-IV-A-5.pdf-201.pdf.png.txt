U.S. intelligence estimated that through 1963 DRV used about $334 million
of aid extended by China, $324 million from the USSR, and about $106 from
East Europe.

The Chinese Communists played a leading role in assistance
for transportation, communication, and the irrigation system. Between 1957
and 1964 they built 14 rice mills, 28 sugar refineries, plus a number
of consumer goods factories. A 1959 loan financed expansion in metallurgy,
chemicals, and electric power. Chinese trainers, advisers, and technicians
averaged 1500 to 3000 per annum. Soviet aid was at first centered on heavy
industry. Technicians -- about 150 to 300 persons yearly -~ were concen-
trated in heavy manufacturing, mining and electric power. After 1960,
Soviet assistance was also provided for telecommunications and agriculture.

The DRV's foreign trade tripled from 1955 to 1963, and
although exports increased from 8% of total trade in 1955, to 37% in 1963,
a deficit remained which had to be financed from aid -- from grants in
1955-1957, and from credit thereafter.

The pattern of trade was also Bloc oriented, as follows:

Together China and USSR accounted for two-thirds of all trade. Total
exports were 60% from agriculture, forestry, fishing and handicrafts,

30% from minerals; 50% of imports were machines and allied equipment. Less
than 15% of all trade was with non-communist nations, consisting mainly of
manufactured goods and chemicals for DRV coal.

Again, 1959 and 1960 were banner years. Compared with
1955, total trade more than doubled by 1959, and nearly tripled by 1960:
