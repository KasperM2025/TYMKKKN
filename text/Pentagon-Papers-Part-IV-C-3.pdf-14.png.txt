FLAMING DART I

DESCRIPTION

The intelligence community does not
see the conditions of political in-
stability in SVN improving in the
months ahead. The political base
for counterinsurgency will remain
weak.

Soviet Premier Kosygin arrives in
Hanoi for a state visit that will
deepen Soviet commitment to the DRV,
and expand Soviet economic and mili-
tary assistance.

Well-coordinated VC attacks hit the
US advisors' barracks at Pleiku and
the helicopter base at Camp Holloway.

The NSC is convened in the evening
(6 Feb. Washington time) and with
the recommendation of McGeorge Bundy,
Ambassador Taylor and General West-
moreland from Saigon, decides on a
reprisal strike against the North in
spite of Kosygin's presence in Hanoi.

Completing a fact-gathering trip to
SVN on the very day of the Pleiku
attack, Bundy acknowledges the bad
state of the GVN both politically
and militarily, but nevertheless
recommends that the US adopt a policy
of "sustained reprisal‚Äù against the
North and that we evacuate US depen-
dents from Saigon. The reprisal
policy should begin from specific VC
attacks but gradually escalate into
sustained attacks as a form of pres-
sure on the DRV to end its support
of the VC and/or come to terms with
the US.

hO US Navy jets conduct the first
FLAMING DART reprisal-attack on the
Dong Hoi army barracks; a scheduled
VNAF attack is cancelled because of
bad weather.
