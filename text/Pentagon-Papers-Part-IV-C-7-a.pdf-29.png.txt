Brown presents three alter-
native air war escalations
that might produce better
results.

A note to Wheeler for informa-
tion from Clifford transmits a
"draft statement" by Rusk
announcing a bombing halt north
of 20°. An attached rationale
does not foresee negotiations
resulting but indicates the time
is opportune because of forth-
coming bad weather over much of
NVN.

President Johnson only narrowly
defeats Eugene McCarthy in a
great moral victory for anti-
Administration doves.

Robert Kennedy, spurred by the
New Hampshire results, announces
for the Presidency.

An ISA draft memo that never
gets SecDef signature proposes
the concentration of the bomb-
ing south of 20° on the infil-
tration routes, with only enough
sorties northward to prevent
relocation of DRV air defenses
to the south.

Nine prestigious former Presi-
dential advisors gather at the
White House for briefings on
the Vietnam situation. After
hearing a report from State,
DoD and CIA, they recommended
ageinst further escalation in
favor of greater efforts to
get peace talks started.

The President announced that

Westmoreland would return to
become CofsS Army in the summer.
