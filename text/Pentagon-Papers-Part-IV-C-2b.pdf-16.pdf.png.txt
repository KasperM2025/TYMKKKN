DESCRIPPION

After a confusing afternoon in

which the attacks were double-checked

and verified, the NSC met again
at 1700, confirmed the reprisal
order, and discussed incremental
force deployments to the Western
Pacific.

At 1845 the President met with
16 Congressional leaders, briefed
them on the proposed attacks

and informed them of his inten-
tion to ask for a joint Congres-
sional resolution of support.
None raised objections.

In an unrelated development,

UN Secretary General U Thant
called for the rescheduling

of the lh-nation conference

to deal with the Laotian situa-
tion.

In a formal message to both
houses of Congress, the Presi-
dent requested passage of a
joint resolution of support

for U.S. policy in Southeast
Asia. Concurrently, identical
draft resolutions prepared by
the executive branch were intro-
duced in the Senate by Senator
Fulbright, and in the House,

by Representative Morgan.

Both houses heard top Adminis-
tration officials, including
Secretary McNamara, testify
in behalf of the pending reso-
lutions.

The additional forces deploy-
ments, particularly air forces,
begin to move to the theatre.

The Tonkin Gulf resolution

was passed in both houses by
near unanimous vote.
