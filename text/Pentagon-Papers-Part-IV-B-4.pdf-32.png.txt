A day later, on 9 May, the JCS formally directed CINCPAC to take
the necessary actions resulting from the Honolulu Conference and revise
the CPSVN. Guidance and terms of reference were provided reflecting the
Secretary of Defense reactions and specifying the decisions reached.
Singled out especially was the requirement for U.S. force withdrawal.
The JCS directive read;

As a matter of urgency a plan for the withdrawal of about
1,000 U.S. troops before the end of the year should be developed
based upon the assumption that the progress of the counter-
insurgency campaign would warrant such a move. Plans should be
based upon withdrawal of US units (as opposed to individuals)
by replacing them with selected and specially trained RVNAF units. 20/

COMUSMACV in turn was tasked to draft the revised CPSVN and prepare a
plan for the 1000-man reduction. CINCPAC, after some changes and revisions,
concurred in the proposed plans and forwarded them to the JCS on 11 May.
The revised outline CPSVN now provided for the following SVN force levels
(in thousands ):

MAP levels provided for were as follows (i millions):

178.9 149.0 130.3 120.) 100.5 85.0 764.1

The proposed plan for withdrawal of the first increment of U.S. forces, in
compliance with instructions, emphasized units rather than individuals, but
the list of so-called "units" scheduled to be included were all smaller than
company size. All Services were represented. The criteria employed, also
based on earlier guidance, were to select most of the personnel from service
support and logistics skills most easily spared and whose release would have
least effect on operations. The total came to 1,003 U.S. military personnel
to be withdrawn from South Vietnam by the end of December 1963. 21/

MAP PLANNING

ISA meanwhile developed tentative dollar guidelines for MAP planning
for Vietnam. The first cut, based on the Secretary of Defense's own sug-
gested total for the FY 65-69 period, was rejected by the Secretary of
Defense as too high and returned, with various desired reductions entered
by the Secretary of Defense. 22/ Reconciling the MAP with the CPSVN
proved to be 4 difficult problem. As CPSVN succeeded, it was logical
that MAP would have to increase; yet CPSVN tried to cut back MAP as well.
For instance, the contemplated phase-out of U.S. artillery-spotter aircraft
squadrons entailed an add-on to MAP to accommodate the squadron's equip-
ment and maintenance after transferral to the Vietnamese.
