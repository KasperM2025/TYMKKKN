nat summer (21 were provided by US), sufficient crews were available
for normal maintenance, It was expected these would be used for
tactical drops of parachute troops, No (rpt no) sustained air lift
operation was or could have been forseen at that time, With loss

of Nehialo and the ensuing necessary decision of French command to
attempt hold Na San to prevent overrunning that country and Laos, an
air lift had to be instituted, As a result, the C-l7's are operating
at several times the normal rate, entailing urgent increased
maintenance,

As an alternative to sending American mechanics, Trapnell and I have
suggested possibility of the 36 planes being sent for repairs and
checks to Clark Field. Trip to Manila would add extra flying time
to the planes, but that might be the more practical operation. I
can see no (rpt no) policy objection either to despatching American
maintenance crews for a few weeks stay here or proyiding maintenance
at Clark Field, On several occasions we have provided mechanical
specialists for brief periods for instruction and repair of certain
American equipment, This emergency maintenance is vital to holding
of Na San and for meeting any other emergency air-borne operations,

General Chassin, CINC French Air Force Fe, arrives today from Tonkin
to consult with Trapnell, F
