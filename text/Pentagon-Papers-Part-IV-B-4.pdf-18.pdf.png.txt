Formally suspended five-year MAP program planning until further
notice: said the previous plans for phasing down US and GVN
forces was superseded by the policy of providing South Vietnam
assistance and support es long us required to bring aggression
end terrorism under control (as per NSAM 238).

Indicated proving US military commitment: this 1500-man aug-
mentation raised the total authorized level to 17,000.

Called in part to examine the GV Kational Campaign Plan -- which was

falling. The conferees agreed to increase RVNAF effectiveness by
extending and intensifying the US advisory effort as MACY
recommended.

Formal MACV request for 900 additional edyisory personnel. His
Justification for advisors at the battalion level and for more
advisors at district and sector levels was included. Also, 30
USS advisors were requested to establish a Junk Force end other
maritime counterinsurgency measures.

CISCPAC recommended approval of the MACY proposal for intensi-
fication of US advisory efforts.

Ambassador Taylor reported that revised VC strength estimates
now put the enemy force between 23,000 and 34,000. io cause
for alarm, he sald the new estimate did demonstrate the magni-
tude of the problem and the need to raise the level of US/GVN
efforts. Taylor thougtita US strength increase to 21,000 by
the end of the year would be sufficient.

MACY requested 3,200 personnel to support the expansion (by 900)
Of US advisory efforts -- or /\,200 more men over the next nine
months.

Ambassador Taylor concurred in MACV's proposed increase, recom-
mended prompt approval and action.
