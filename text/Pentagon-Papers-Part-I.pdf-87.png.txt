But Ho's explanation notwithstanding, the Viet Minh was irrefutably
nationalist, popular, and patriotic. It was also the most prominent and
successful vehicle of Viet nationalism in the 1940's. Toa degree it was
always non-communist. Available evidence indicates, however, that from
its inception, Ho Chi Minh and his lieutenants of the Indochinese Com-
munist Party conceived its strategy, directed its operations, and channeled
its energies consistent with their own goals-~as they subsequently claimed.
Whether the non~communist elements of the Viet Minh might have become
dominant in different circumstances must be relegated to speculation.

It seems clear that, as matters developed, all of the non-communist
nationalist movements--reformist, theocratic, or revolutionary--were too
localized, too disunited, or too tainted with Japanese or Nationalist
Chinese associations to have competed successfully with the ICP for con-
trol of the Viet Minh. And none could compete effectively with the Viet
Minh in gaining a following among Vietnam's peasants.
