question:

---4. It is anticipated that one of the first questions
President Diem will raise with you after your presentation of
the above joint proposals will be that of introducing U.S.
combat troops. You are authorized to remind him that the actions
we already have in mind involve a substantial number of U.S.
military personnel for operational duties in Viet-Nam and that
we believe that these forces performing crucial missions can
greatly increase the capacity of GVN forces to win their war
against the Viet Cong. You can also tell him that we believe
that the missions being undertaken by our forces, under present
circumstances, are more suitable for white foreign troops than
garrison duty or missions involving the seeking out of Viet Cong
personnel submerged in the Viet-Nam population. You can assure
him that the USG at highest levels will be in daily contact with
the situation in Viet-Nam and will be in constant touch with him
about requirements of the situation.... 20a/
