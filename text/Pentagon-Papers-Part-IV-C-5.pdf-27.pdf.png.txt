McCone said the communists still
saw the tide going their way.

They would see in the Honolulu
expansions of U.S. involvement

the acceptance by the U.S. of 4
greater commitment, but they would
assume U.S. was reluctant to widen
the war. The DRV and Chicoms might
reinforce with men and equipment,
but would not intervene.

The presence in Kontum Province

since February 1965 of one regiment

of the 325th PAVN Division confirmed.
As of late 1964 the supply of repatri-
ated southerners infiltrated back from
NVN had dried up and NVN volunteers
were coming down the trail.

Unger told Taylor that if Quat agrees
to the Honolulu program, the U.S.
intention was not to announce the
whole thing at once "but rather to
announce individual deployments at
appropriate times.”

Sharp recommended replacing the 173d,
if it deployed, with a CONUS brigade.

Taylor told State that Quat was extremely

a detailed program to depley
48,000 U.S. and 5250 Free World
troops to SVN. The forces included
two Army brigades, one MEB, an ROK
Regt. Combat Team, and an ANZAC

battalion. They were to bolster 5

GVN forces during their continued
build-up, secure bases and installa-
tions, conduct combat operations in
