The evolution of political conditions necessitates that

policy guidance should be directed at the problem of

dealing with Sihanouk of Cambodia, "by all odds the

major single factor in Cambodia and the principal target

of U.S. policy.". Further, the guidance of NSC 5809 is

not adequate to cope with the situation in Laos. OCB

Special Report on Southeast Asia, 10 February 1960.......06.. 12h9

The Vietnam Country Team prepares a special report on
the current security situation in Vietnam. "...the
rural population is generally apathetic towards the Diem
Government and there are signs of considerable dissatis-

_ faction and silent opposition.” Without support of the

rural population, no final solution can be found to the

internal security problem. Militarily, the GVN organi-

zation lacks unity of command. The situation is summed

up.....the government has tended to treat the population

with suspicion or to coerce it and has been rewarded

with an attitude of apathy or resentment." Saigon 278

The President approves changes in NSC 5809 and directs
implementation as NSC 6012, "U.S. Policy in Mainiand

Southeast Asia.” Policies toward Vietnam are essen-

tially unchanged. NSC 6012, 25 July 1960.....usscaccccssescs 1201

Developments in South Vietnam indicate an adverse trend

and if they remain unchecked will almost certainly cause

the collapse of President Diem's regime. SNIR 63-.1-60,
