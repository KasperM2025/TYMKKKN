"T want to discuss with you today the status of our strength and our
security because this question clearly calls for the most responsible
qualities of leadership and the most enlightened products of scholarship.

nor are they quickly and simply explained. There are many kinds of strength

the strength we stood ready to use on behalf of the principles we stand
ready to defend."

"But American military might should not and need not stand alone

against the ambitions of international communism. Our security and
strength, in the last analysis, directly depend on the security and
