Toward the end of May the MAP dollar ceiling for FY 64 was estab-
lished at $180 million. But for the period after FY 64 both the MAP
and the CPSVN were far from being settled. On 29 May CINCPAC was directed
to develop three alternative plans in comparative terms based on the fol-
lowing total dollar levels for the FY 65-69 period:

a. $585 million (derived from the current proposed CPSVIN).

b. $450 million (compromise).

ce. $365 million (SecDef goal).

Funding guidelines for each of the three versions were provided as follows:

Plan ($ millions) FY 65 Fy 66 = FY â€˜67 ry & FY 69
585 150 130 120 100 85
450 150 120 70) - | 160 50
365 ESS 90 20 50 50

Implied was that a choice would be made somewhere within this range. 23/

A new, complex MAP-CPSVN planning cycle was thus set in motion that
would not fully run its course for almost a year longer. CINCPAC responded
by preparing the comparative analysis of the alternative MAP levels, as
instructed, but besides the three plans required, introduced a fourth ver-
sion developed by the Joint Staff and identified as "Plan J," which fell
mid-range and came to $450.9 million. Submitted to the JCS on 18 July,
the four plans were reviewed at length, with the upshot that the JCS added
a fifth plan identified as the "Model M Plan," the totel cost of which fell
closer to the bottom-range figure but still came to $400 million. It pro-
vided for higher force levels deemed necessary during the critical period
FY 65 and FY 66, and thus go above the Secretary of Defense desired ceiling
of $365 million. The breakout of the Model M Plan was as follows:

FY 65 FY 66 FY 67 Fy 68 FY 69
SVN military strength
(thousands ) 225.5 225.5 148.8 122.0 121.2

MAP costs ($ millions) 145.2 117.2 51.2 5.1 41.3

All five plans were forwarded by the JCS on 27 August, with the recommenda-
tion that the Secretary of Defense approve the Model M Plan. 2h./

ISA concurred in the JCS recommendation with certain minor reserva-
tions, 25/ and on 6 September, the Secretary of Defense accordingly
approved the Model M Plan as a basis for development of the FY 65-69 MAPs.
However, the Secretary at the same time advised the JCS that U.S. materiel
turned over to SVN units would henceforth be charged to the MAP. Such costs
