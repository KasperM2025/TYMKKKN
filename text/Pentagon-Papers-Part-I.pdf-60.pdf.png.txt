"To date the Vietnam press and radio have not adopted
an anti-American position. It is rather the French colonial
press that has been strongly anti-American and has freely
accused the U.S. of imperialism in Indochina to the point
of approximating the official Moscow position. Although the
Vietnam radio has been closely watched for a new position
toward the U.S., no change has appeared so far. Nor does
there seem to have been any split within the coalition govern-
ment of Vietnam....

"Evaluation. If there is a Moscow-directed conspiracy
in Southeast Asia, Indochina is an anomoly so far. Possible
explanations are:

1. No rigid directives have been issued by Moscow.

2. The Vietnam government considers that it has
no rightest elements that must be purged,

3. The Vietnam Communists are not subservient to
the foreign policies pursued by Moscow.

hk, A special dispensation for the Vietnam govern-
ment has been arranged in Moscow.

Of these possibilities, the first and fourth seem most likely."71/
