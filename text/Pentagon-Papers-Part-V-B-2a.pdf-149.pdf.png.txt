#2096, October 18, 2 p.m., from Nanking

Dai "the Chinese people would not regard favorably the
reestablishment of a monarchy in Indochina. Bao-Dai

has not recently been in Nanking (REDEPTEL 1205,
September 29) and FONOFF officials made oblique reference
to a "French story" to that effect.

Embassy comment: while no direct statement was vouch-
safed by FONOFF officials as to Chinese attitude toward
National Union or Nguyen Hai Than, foregoing would

appear to indicate FONOFF does not contemplate support

of Bao-Dai who would seem to be an indispensable element
in present French plans and that a dubious view, at best,
is taken of National Union movement. As Dept is aware
there are diverse Chinese elements interested in the
Tndochina situation and views given above do not purport
to represent crystallized Chinese attitude. No allusion was
made during interview to possible mediation by third power
or powers.
