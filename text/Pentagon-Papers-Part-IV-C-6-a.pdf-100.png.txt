LIGHT OF OUR SERIOUS INFLATIONARY PROBLEM. THIS REPRESENTS AN
INCREASE OF 6 BILLION PIASTERS ABOVE THE CURRENT PiASTER

CEILING FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR OF 36 BILLION PIASTERS. WHILE IT

IS CLEAR THAT SOME INCREASE OVER THE CURRENT CEILING IS
NECEUSARY IN VIEW OF THE TROOP BUILDUP, | FEEL THAT AN INCREASE
ABOVE 42 BILLION WOULD BE DANGEROUS. SUCH AN INCREASE WOULD
CONFRONT US WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN STILL FURTHER REDUCING CIVILIAN
VROGRANS OR FACING DANGEROUS INFLATION DURING 1967. NEITHER

OF THESE ALTERNATIVES 1S ACCEPTABLE.

4. 1, THEREFORE, RECOMMEND THAT WASHINGTON APPROVE MY

PROPOSAL FOR U.S. PIASTER SPENDING YHICH, WHEN ADDED TO
VIETNAMESE SPENDING, WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING GRAND TOTAL:

A MILITARY SENIOR BUDGET OF 92BILLION PIASTERS OF WHICH 59

WOULD BE FOR VNAF AND 42 FOR MACV, AND A CIVILIAN PLASTER

BUDGET OF 41 BILLION, OF WHICH 25 WOULD BE FOR GVN CIVIL BUDGET,
16 FOR USAID, AND 6 FOR NON-USAID U.S. MOHER EXPENDITURES

TOTAL 15 BILLION, OF WHICH CREDIT EXPANSION AMOUNTS TO 12.

THIS MAKES A TOTS ‘s OF PLASTER EXPENDITURES OF 148 BILLION,
FACTORS YHICH DECREASE THE MONEY SUPPLY, SUCH AS IMPORTS

AND TAXES, ARE ESTIMATED TO TOTAL 133 BILLION PIASTERS, LEAVING
A SO-CALLED "GAP" OF 13 BILLION (SEPARATE TELEGRAM LL FOLLOW

GIVING FURTHER DETAILS).

@ WEAKNESSES OF THE GVN

15. QLEASE NOTE TWO POINTS WHICH REINFORCE THE NECESSITY FOR
KEEPING OUR PLANNED "INFLATIONARY GAP" TO 1@ BILLION PIASTERS
OR LESS.

16. FIRST, | DOUBT WHETHER ANY STABILIZATION AGREEMENT HERE

CAN DO SO MUCH OR SO WELL AS DESCRIBED IN REF Ce VIETNAMESE
OFFICIALS WILL PROBABLY TRY TO OBLIGE US BY AGREEING 10 A NUMBER
OF THINGS, SIMPLY IN ORDER TO BE POLITE. BUT WHEN IT CONES T0
MEASURES WHICH REALLY HAVE SOVE TEETH, | AM NOT OPTIMISTIC.
WHAT MADE KY*S MEASURES ON DEVALUATION AND PORT OPERATIONS
VALUABLE IS THAT THEY WERE THINGS WHICH WERE CLEARCUT AND WHICH
HE COULD CARRY OUT. | FEAR A MUCH LARGER U-S.-SPONSORED PROGRAM
IN VIET+NAM BECAUSE | BELIEVE THAT THE GVN IS AOMINISTRATIVELY
TOO WEAK TO KARRY THEM OUT AND SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE STILL

VERY STRONG. IT IS A BIT LIKE A FLYSHEEL BELT WHICH CAN BE
TIGHTENED SO MUCH THAT TRACTION 1S LOST AND THE MOTOR MERELY
SPINS WITHOUT GETTING THE FLYWHEEL TO VOVE. AS | HAVE SAID

IN PREVIOUS TELEGRAMS, | BELIEVE THERE 1S A RATE AT WHICH
THESE PEOPLE CAN GO AHEAD AND ANYTHING BEYOND THAT RATE
TENDS TO BE LIP SER VICE» THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES, IN MY

MIND, TO i RESEMBLE UITTLE EVA, JUNPING FROM ICE FLOE TO ICE
FLOE. THIS MAKES THE SEPTEMBER 11 ELECTION A PARTICULARLY

fe LOOME MIRACLE, BUT SOWEWHAT OF A VIRACLE NEVERTHELESS.

THE GOVERNMENT ° § POSITION IS TENUOUS AND PRECARIOUS.

17. SECOND, OUR GAP ESTIMATES ARE ON THE OPTIMISTIC SIDE. |
DOUBT WHETHER THE GVN CAN RAISE DOMESTIC TAX REVENUES FROM
ABOUT 13.5 BILLION PIASTERS THIS YEAR TO 26 BILLION PIASTERS
NEXT YEAR. FURTHERMORE, GIVEN THE PRESENT LULL IN THE MARKET
