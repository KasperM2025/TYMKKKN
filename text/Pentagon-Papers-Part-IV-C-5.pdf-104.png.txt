"A. Actions recommended:

"(1) Deploy at once to I CTZ the remaining two BLT's
of the 3d Marine Division and appropriate supporting division
and air elements (approximately 8,000 personnel). Reconstitute
the SLF as a floating reserve.

"(2) Deploy balance of increment 1 and all of incre-
ment 2 (as defined in Reference C /Ref C was an earlier MACV
message of 26 May 1965/ of Army logistic and other support
units in accordance with schedule set out in Reference D.
[Ref D was a U.S. Army Support Command Vietnam message of
31 May/ (Approximately 8,000 personnel) =

"(3) Deploy the U.S. Army Air Mobile Division (and
logistic increment 3) through Qui Nhon to An Khe, Pleiku and
Kontum (approximately 21,000 personnel). Qui Nhon will be
ready to receive the division approximately 1 August upon the
closure of increment 2 forces.

"(4) Coneurrently with the Air Mobile Division, deploy
I Corps Headquarters (approximately 1,500 personnel).

"(5) Deploy the ROK Marine RCT to Cam Ranh Bay as soon
after 1 July as the unit can be readied for movement (approxi-
mately 4,000 personnel). Deploy balance of the ROK division
force (approximately 14,500 personnel) plus U.S. logistic incre-
ment 4 (1,500 personnel), starting 15 September to the general
area of Qui Nhon. (This answers Ref E /CINCPAC message of
5 June/ in part - separate message on pages 96 through 103.)

"(6) Deploy additional tactical fighter squadrons to
Cam Ranh Bay when expeditionary landing field complete at that
location. Also provide naval aircraft carrier support of in-
country operations as required; we believe the latter will
engage one carrier full time.

the Air Mobile Division has deployed and is ready for operations.

"(8) Continue air attacks against the DRV. (Reference F
/Macv message of 20 May/ applies)
