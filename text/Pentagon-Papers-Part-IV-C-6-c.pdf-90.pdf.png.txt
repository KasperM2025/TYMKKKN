The South Vietnamese know that further efforts are
going to be required:

-- to expand their own armed forces,

-~- to move back into the countryside as quickly as
possible,

~~ to increase their taxes,

-- to select the very best men that they have for
civilian and military responsibility,

-- to achieve a new unity within their constitutional
government,

-- and to include in the national effort all of those
groups who wish to preserve South Vietnam's control over
its own destiny.

Last week President Thieu ordered the mobilization of
135,000 additional South Vietnamese. He plans to reach --
as soon as possible -- 4 total military strength of more
than 800,000 men.

To achieve this, the government of South Vietnam

. started the drafting of 19-year-olds on March lst. On

May lst, the Government will begin the drafting of 18-year-
olds.

last month, 10,000 men volunteered for military service ~-
that was two and a half times the number of volunteers during
the same month last year. Since the middle of January, more
than 48,000 South Vietnamese have joined the armed forces --
and nearly half of them volunteered to do soa.

All men in the South Vietnamese armed forces have had
their tours of duty extended for the duration of the war,
and reserves are now being called up for immediate active

duty.
President Thieu told his people last week:

"we mast make greater efforts and accept more sacrifices
because, as I have said many times, this is our country.
The existence of our nation is at stake, and this is mainly
a, Vietnamese responsibility."

He warned his people that a major national effort is
required to root out corruption and incompetence at all
