Leadership of Vietnam GOVT during this crucial period is e
factor of preponderant importance in deciding ultimate outcome,
GOVT must display unusually aggressive leadership and courage be-
fore a discouraged people, distrausht and floundering in the wake
of years of civil war. Lesser considerations concerning the
modalities of relations between the States of the FR Union and the
REP of FR must, for instance, be at least temporarily leid aside
in face of serious threat to very existence of Vietnam as autonomous
state, within FR Union or otherwise,

We are aware (as is Bao Dai) that present Vietnamese GOVT is so
linked with person of Chief of State that leadership and exampl
- provided by latter takes on extraordinary importance in determining
degree of efficiency in functioning of GOVT, Through circimstances
of absence in FR of Bao Dai and other Vietnamese leaders for prolonged
period, opportunity for.progress in assuzotion of responsibilities
from FR and extension authority and influence of GOV? with people
was neglected, Many people, ‘including great nuniber AMERS, have
been unable understand reasons for Emperor's GTE prolonged holiday
UNGTE on Riviera and have nisinterpreted it as an indication orf
lack of patriotic attachment to his role of Chief of State. Dirt
is at least of opinion that his absence did not enhance the
authority and prestige of his GOVT at home.

Therefore, DEPI considers it imperative Bao Dai give Vietnamese
people evidence his determination personally take up reing of state
and lead his country into IMMED and energetic opposition COMMIS
menace, Specifically he SHLD embark upon IMMED program of visits
to all parts Vietnem making numerous speeches and public apperances
in the process, Chief of State SHLD declare his determination plunge
into job of rallying people to support of GOVT and opposition to VM
IMMED upon arrival Saigon, He SHLD announce US, FR support for
formation NATL armies and his owm intention assume role Commander
in Chie?, He SHLD take full advantage of FR official declaration
o” intention to form NATL armies (confirmed yesterday by MIN ASSC

tates Letourneau) and set up precise plan for such formation
