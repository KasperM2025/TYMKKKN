We discussed plans for military operations in
Indochina. These are being developed by the French
General Navarre who has recently gone there. Our Govern-
ment sent General O'Daniel to confer with him. We
beleive that the new French plans are vigorous and
deserve to be implemented in that spirit. The United
States has a large interest in the matters because our
position in the Western Pacific could be put in jeopardy
if Communists weré allowed to overrun the Southeast
Asian peninsula of which Indochina forms a major part.
We are already helping there with material aid. This
involves the second largest cost item of our Mutual
Security Program, participation in the NATO Army being
first. I believe we should help effective resistance
to Communist agsressors everywhere, and in Indochina it
may save us from having to spend much more money to
protect our vital interests in the Pacific.

We also agreed that an armistice in Korea. must not
result in jeopardizing the restoration of peace in
other parts of Asia. In this connection we thought
particularly of Indochina.

As President Eisenhower said in his April 16 address,
an armistice in Korea that merely released aggressive
armies to attack elsewhere would be a fraud. We are
on our guard against that.

2. Our program for Europe and Asia is a program
for peace and for the liberty and justice which are
necessary if peace is to be durable. Repression can
give ‘the illusion of peace, but it is only illusion.
For sooner or later the repression becomes unbearable
and human emotions explode with violance....That is why
we seek peace in Indochina on the basis of freedom and
independence which the French Government now promises
the peoples.
