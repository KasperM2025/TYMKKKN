The Parties undertake, as set forth
in the Charter of the United Nations,
to settle any international dispute
in which they may be involved by
peaceful means in such a manner that
international peace and security and
justice are not endangered, and to
refrain in their international rela-
tions from the threat or use of force
in any manner inconsistent with the
purposes of the United Nations.

ARTICLE 2

The Parties will contribute toward the
further development of peaceful and
friendly international relations by
strengthening their free institutions,
by bringing about a better under-
standing of the principles upon which
these institutions are founded, and
by promoting conditions of stability

eliminate conflict in their inter-
national economic policies and will
encourage economic collaboration
between any or all of them.

operate with one another in the
