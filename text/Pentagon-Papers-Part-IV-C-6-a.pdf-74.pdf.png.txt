As far as the pattern which American forces in Vietnam followed,
there seemed to be an initial preoccupation in the spring of 1966 with
the Viet Cong and NVA units located in the populated areas, Quang Neai
in the I Corps, Binh Dinh and Phu Yen in the II Corps and Hau Nehia
and Binh Duong in the III Corps.

B. Phase ITA(R) Becomes Program No. 3

1. Bookkeeping Changes

Reflecting the relatively low level of combat and the preoccupa-
tion with the build-up of U.S. forces, only minor changes and adjust-
ments to the figures in the plan were made during the two months following
the publication of Phase IIA(R). By June, however, the number of changes
had begun to build up. Assistant Secretary Enthoven, in his 10 June 1966
memorandum to Secretary McNamara, reported that there had been "a large
number of changes proposed by the Army...This package of deployment ad-
justments is the result of detailed CONARC studies of unit availability
based upon equipment inventories, personnel training outputs, etc. These
changes affect virtually every month and type of unit." 2

Assistant Secretary Enthoven then followed this with a memorandum
on 13 June 1966 providing copies of the current statistical summary of
deployments and an explanation of the major changes. Most of these were
bookkeeping in nature, having to do with changes in the base from which
future strengths were computed and certain other adjustments such as
eliminating transients from the totals. This made no change in battalion
strengths but brought the December 1966 and June 1967 totals to 378,000
and 427,000, respectively. 3/

On 16 June, Secretary Mcllamara, in a handwritten note in the margin
of this latest Enthoven memorandum, directed Dr. Enthoven to make some
changes in strengths to be included and to issue the revised plan as a
separate document, not as part of the statistical summary.

By 30 June, when Enthoven sent the revised plan back to McNamara
for approval, two changes had occurred which brought the totals for
December 66 and June 67 to 391,000 and 431,000. ‘These changes were the
acceleration of the deployment of two brigades of the 9th Infantry
Division from January 67 to December 66, and the availability of the
196th Infantry Brigade for deployment in August of 1966. This brigade
was originally scheduled for deployment to Dominican Republic, but was
diverted to Vietnam. These changes brought the total of U.S. maneuver
battalions scheduled to be in Vietnam by the end of 1966 to 79 and the
total by June 67 to 82, 4/

2. The Pen is Quicker Than The Bye

The question arises here as to why this revision of the plan
became Program No. 3 rather than “change x" to the 10 April Plan. ‘The
