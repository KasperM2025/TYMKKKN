f. Significant measures to improve the RVNAF are
being taken but only limited improvement can be expected
within a reasonable time frame.

g. Efforts to obtain additional allied,forces
should continue; however, US requirements or capability
should not be reduced until the commitments are firm.

h. Communist reactions to Courses A and B, and to
the increased air and naval campaign would most likely
fall short of forcing a confrontation with the Soviets
or Chinese Communists but would involve attempted increased
material assistance to NVN and increased propaganda against
the United States. Free World support for the United States
in each case would not differ materially from the present
except where the attacks involved Cambodia.

i.. US public reaction to Course A probably would be
_ more favorable than to Course B over the long term.

j. A settlement of the conflict in shorter time
at less cost should result from initiating Course A,
together with a more effective air campaign.

k. Post-settlement conditions in SEAsia are likely
to be better under Course A because of the greater level
of US forces on the scene. 18/
