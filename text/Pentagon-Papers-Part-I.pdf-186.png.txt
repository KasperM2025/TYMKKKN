TOP SECRET ~ Sensitive

To base our entire Asian policy on "containing" China is to risk
billions of dollars and thousands of lives on the idea that China plans
to take over other countries by military expansion -- a hypothesis not
supported either by her words or by the history of her behavior so far,
and. one that in the case of the Soviet Union turned out to be false. And
to make the hypothesis doubly faulty, it assumes that even if China wanted
to expand, she could.
