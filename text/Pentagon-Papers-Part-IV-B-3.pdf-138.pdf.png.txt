The PROVN Study proposed that leverage be employed at eae
within GVYN to achieve U.S. objectives. Noting that past uses had been
haphazard, it recommended the employment of a "continuum from subtle

effective tool." The direct involvement end leverege en~ -

minorities, and unsure of its tenure end legitimacy wili
