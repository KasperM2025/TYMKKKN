Excerpt from Arthur M. Schlesinger, A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy

in the White House, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1965, De Seu

1951: “In Indochina," Kennedy said, on his return to Washington,
“we have allied ourselves to the desperate effort of a French regime
to hang on to the remnants of empire....To check the southern drive
of communism makes sense but not only through reliance on the force
of arms. The task is rather to build strong native non-communist
sentiment within these areas and rely on that as a spearhead of defense
rather than upon the legions of General de lattre. To do this apart
from and in defiance of innately nationalistic aims Spells foredoomed
failure." The trip gave Kennedy both a new sympathy for the problems
of Asia and a new understanding of the power of nationalism in the
underdeveloped world.
