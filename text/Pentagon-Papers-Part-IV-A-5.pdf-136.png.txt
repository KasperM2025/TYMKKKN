we feel that it is our duty -- and in the case of a nation in
turmoil even the most humble people have their share of respon-
sibility -- to speak the truth, to awaken public opinion, to
alert the people, and to unify the opposition so as to point
the way. We beseech the government to urgently modify its
policies so as to remedy the situation, to defend the republi-
can regime, and to safeguard the existence of the nation. We
hold firm hope that the Vietnamese people shall know a brilli-
ant future in which it will enjoy peace and prosperity in free-
dom and progress.

Yours respectfully,
