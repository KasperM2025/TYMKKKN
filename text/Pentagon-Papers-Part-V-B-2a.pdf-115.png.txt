101. ReDeptel 241, September 9. 2 ». m., fo Srigen. There ap-

parently is contact between Vietnam and Chinese Communists.
Reports difficult to verify indicate presence in Vietnam of Chinese
Communists who are said to he used as advisors in provinces. Num-
bers are not known but estimates run to hundreds. Traffic apparently
is directed by sea from Shanghai to Hong Kong, thence to Haiphong,
However. any reports concerning presence of Chinese Communists
in Haiphong itself should be regarded with suspicion. Pirates from
South China have combined with Chinese Army deserters to black-
mail Chinese congregating there. While calling themselves Com-
munists, they are actually outlaws.
