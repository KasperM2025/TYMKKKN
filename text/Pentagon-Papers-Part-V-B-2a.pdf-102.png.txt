There are three important political parties in Viet Nam.

They are Viet Minh League, composed of former Indo-Cliinese
Communist Party (PCT dissolved itself November 30, 1945) and
Deinoeratic Party, son fs’e] Vietnam Cach Menh Doane: Minh Toi,
generally referred toas Dong Miuh Moi or DMI; and Vietuam Quoe
Dan Dang.

There are in addition several splinter parties which seem to serve
chiefly as veliicles for organized banditry.

Both Dong Minh Hoi and Ouoe Dan Dane seem have support of
Chinese. Most active part of Viet Minh is factor composed of former
PCI members.

Viet Minh streneth seeins to he spread throughout northern Indo-
“China. Dong Minh Hoi and Quoe Dan Dang control territory in
Moneay, Langson, Vinh Yen area?

®Vice Consul O'Snllivan, in teletran: 69, Tuly 26, 1946. 4 p.m. from Hanoi,
reported the steady elimination of all organized opposition to the Viet Minh
Leasne. The Done Minh Toi and Quoe Dan Dane had lost influence with the
departure of the 42nd Chinese Army from Tonkin. (S51G.00/7-2t16)

As yet no Catholic party has appeared nor do Catholics appear to
be committed fo supnort of any one party, Viet Minh League has
been making tentative moves fo capture Catholic support but is said
to be too radical to obtain full cooperation from church. Tn view of
fact chureh claims million members in Tonking and Annam (laree

percentage believed to be “rice Christians”), it seems probable that ~

Catholicsas group will [not 7] remain long absent from politics,
