preached an anti-foreigner creed, and in
1945 joined the anti-French, anti-British
resistance. In 1917, Huynh Phu So, the
sect's leader, was executed by the Viet
Minh, which led to the defection of the
Hoa Hao from the resistance, and the sect's
support of Bao Dai's restoration. Rela-
tions with the French, and with rival
Vietnamese factions, remained strained.

A movement centered chiefly on the over-
seas Chinese community, and advocated
passive resistance to the Viet Minh.

Organized by and around the Catholic
clergy, the League exercised varying de-
grees of influence over some 2,000,000
Catholics, chiefly in Annam. The League
supported the DRV in 1945 and 1946, and
approved struggle for Vietnam's independence.
Ngo Dinh Diem led the League into the
National Union Front, but the League split
with the Front over the desire of the
majority to back the resistance, and the
repugnance of the remainder, including
Diem, at Bao Dai'â€™s inability to break
France's control over Vietnam.

A Saigon-sited gangster apparatus which
originally fought as allies of the Viet
Minh, but -- like the Hoa Hao -- were
disaffected by the Viet Minh's shooting
of several of their leaders. Provided
tepid support for Bao Dai, and remained
wary of the French.

An outgrowth of the National Union Front
formed in December, 1947, in Hanoi, the
Rally attempted to merge the various pro-
Bao Dai parties in Cochinchina, Annam, and
Tonkin. Such success as it enjoyed was a
matter of form rather than substance, and
its influence was quite limited.
