DESCRIPTION

The previously aborted VNAF strike
is carried out against the Vu Con
Barracks with US aircraft flying
cover.

Taylor cables his support of the
McGeorge Bundy proposal but lays. his
stress on the- sustained air cempaign
as a means of pressuring the DRV to
"cease its intervention,‚Äù rather than
as @ means of strengthening the
allied position in the South.

In an act of defiance, the VC bomb
a US enlisted men's billet in Qui
Nhon, killing 23 Americans.

Within 24 hours of the VC attack,
the US reteliates in an air attack
on the Chap Le and Chanh Hoa Army
Berracks. The attack is not linked
specifically by the White House to
Qui Nhon but to a list of VC inci-
dents.

Taylor outlines tough terms for any
end to the bombing. The DRV must
cease its intervention, the VC end
the insurgency, both return to the
1954 and 1962 accords.

Responding to a McNemara request and
within his limitations, the JCS
recommend an 8-week air campaign
ageinst the North confined mostly to
panhandle targets and with targets

to be attacked in the order of ascen-
ding risk. General McConnell did not
feel the proposal was adequate. To
earry out the progrem, additional
deployments are recuested.

Taylor further spells out his "gredu-
ated reprisul" concept, giving as its
objectives in the order of their
importance: (1) to affect the will of
Hanoi; (2) to bolster GVN morale; and
(3) to physically damage the DRV and
thereby reduce its ability to support
the VC.
