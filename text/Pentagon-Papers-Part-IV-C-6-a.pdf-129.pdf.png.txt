Enclosed for your signature is a memorandum to the
JCS replying to their November 4 memorandum submitting
recommended deployments to Southeast Asia for FY 67-68.
Their recommended program and my proposed alternative
(Program #4) are compared below with the CINCPAC P46
billion force. The major elements of the OSD and JCS
forces are compared in greater detail on the attached
table:

CINCPAC P.46 Bil. 392 WLS 476 48h 508
Program #4 391 hho h63 469 469

In general my proposal follows the CINCPAC 46 billion
piaster alternative force. The JCS recommended force ignores
piasters and the JCS do not endorse the Pl6 billion force.

My alternative adds five maneuver battalions (3 armored cavalry
and 2 infantry) compared to 6 maneuver battalions (3 armored
cavalry and 2 infantry and 2 airborne) in the CINCPAC Pl6
billion force. Both add 10 artillery battalions. The CINCPAC
force adds 5 tactical air squadrons, Program #4 cuts the cur-
rent program by 1 squadron (the F-100 squadron to deploy in
March to replace the E-5 squadron to be converted to the VNAF).

My proposed force provides about 25,000 fewer Army sup-
port personnel with only 1 fewer maneuver battalion than in
the P46 billion force. The JCS will most likely claim that the
recommended force is not balanced. However, our forces are
operating effectively at present with an even leaner mix of
support personnel. Program #4 consists of about 6 1/3 Army
division equivalents. If the U.S. ARVN advisors and 2 separate
armored cavalry regiments are excluded, the division slice
is about 48,000. While U.S. forces are also providing some
Support for 3rd country troops and to an extent to the ARVN,
this division slice appears adequate.

The JCS state their recommendation is exclusive of any
personnel needed by Task Force 728. In the absence of data
as to the TF 728 requirements, I cannot sey that all of its
needs are met by my recommended force. However, the air
cavalry, armored cavalry, and related units were included
in my force primarily because of their usefulness for a
barrier operation. Furthermore, the inflationary situation
