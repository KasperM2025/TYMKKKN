"But both before and after 1953 events have demonstrated that our
nuclear retaliatory power is not enough. It cannot deter Communist ag-
gression which is too limited to justify atomic war. It cannot protect
uncommitted nations against a Communist tekeover using local or guerrilla
forces. It cannot be used in so-called brush-fire peripheral wars. In

gressions - or be certain of having enough time to decide on the use of
our nuclear power."
