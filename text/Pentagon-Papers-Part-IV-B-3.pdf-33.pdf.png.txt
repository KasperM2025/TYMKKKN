Westmoreland reported to CINCPAC
on poor guality and performance
of ARVN. First 10 months of 1966,
the number of ARVN maneuver
battalions with minimally accept-
able operational strength fluc-
tuated from 31 to 78 of total of
121 organized units.

Pacification listed as third
strategic objective and five
programs concerned with pacifica-
tion were outlined, heralding re+
emphasis on pacification in 1967.

JCS replied to Rostow's draft
after consulting CINCPAC; stiffen-
ing and making more specific U.S.
commitment to war, introducing
term "revolutionary development,"
eliminated references to "national
reconciliation" for ex-VC, and
watered down commitment to
constitutional-electoral efforts
underway Â«

In Dee 1966 a 12-officer team
from each ARVN had undergone
training on RD support so that
each might instruct its division
on the new duties. The division
training programs began in Jan 67.

MACV described new Hamlet Evalu~
ation System (HES) to CINCPAC.

McNaughton draft for Vietnam
strategic guidelines incorporated
most JCS recommendations, empha-
sized security, anbi-infrastructure
and intelligence in support of k/D,
pushed "National Reconciliation."

Westmoreland stated that the
effectiveness of RVNAF mist be
inereased and that its imese must
be improved.
