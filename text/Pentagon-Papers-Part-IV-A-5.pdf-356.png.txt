.General McGarr was informed by this study, and by his other prepara-
tions for his new assignment, of the increasing concern in Washington
about the military situation in Vietnam.

On 24 March 1960, the Chief of Staff of the Army had
called for urgent measures to improve the counterguerrilla capabilities
of RVNAF. ¥ On 30 March 1960, the JCS advised CINCPAC (telegram JCS
974802, date cited) that:

"The JCS agree that anti-guerrilla capability should be
developed within organization of the regular armed forces by
changing emphasis in training selected elements ARVN and other
forces from conventional to anti-guerrilla warfare.”

On 27 April 1960, CINCPAC submitted a study on counterinsurgency in
South Vietnam to the JCS. On 6 June, JCS forwarded this study to the
Secretary of Defense, recommending his acting to obtain U.S. Govern-
ment support of counterinsurgency operations. ** The initial recom-
mendation was followed by a proposed outline plan. The Secretary

of Defense obtained the necessary concurrence in Washington, and on
20 October CINCPAC and Ambassador Durbrow were directed to develop
the detailed plan and submit it to Washington (Joint State-DOD Message
192020Z October 1960).

In the meantime, Chief, MAAG, with the assistance of
additional U.S. Army Special Forces, began in June a new training
program for RVNAF designed to improve its counterguerrilla capabilities.
Also, in September by SM-906-60 (15 September 1960), the Joint Chiefs
of Staff had instructed subordinate commanders to take steps to improve
guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare training. In early 1961, the
Director of the Joint Staff, It. General Earle G. Wheeler (DJSM-158-61,
9 February 1961) circulated a paper prepared by General McGarr to
improve that training in Vietnam. The paper, entitled "Information,
Guidance and Instructions to MAAG Advisory Personnel by It. General
Lionel C. McGarr, November 10, 1960," called for the training of RVNAF
to produce the “anti-guerrilla guerrilla." General McGarr pointed
out that the guerrilla derived his principal strength from conventional .
opponents, and that he had to be defeated in his own chosen form of
combat:

"There is only one way he can survive -- capitalize on the
conventional concept by taking advantage of the inherent
