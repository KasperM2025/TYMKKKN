the Vietnamese Government, because he has told them, if I
remember his words correctly, that he was there to work himself
out of a job.

"Mr. Ambassador?

"MR. DURBROW. That is one of the principal jobs we are doing
there. We work on this at all times, working out the projects
and plans for aid needed, discussing them with the Vietnamese
officials and trying to do all we can to build up a sound basic
economic structure so that they will become economically inde-
pendent.

"I might add that this is the goal of all of these newly-
developing countries and, particularly, Vietnam.

"The President has said to all of us many times:

"We are grateful for your aid, but we hope we can get on our
feet as soon as possible," and that is one of the principal
objectives we are trying to carry out.

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. You are to be commended for it. That is
@ sound statement.

"So far as the aid programs are concerned, we have sought
to achieve our various objectives, have we not, primarily
through support of the Vietnamese armed forces and by assistance
in the rehabilitation of the Vietnamese economy."

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. Now, Mr. Durbrow, in the opening statements
at this hearing we have had a picture drawn of some very signifi-
cant changes in the situation in Vietnam since 1955.

"We know, for example, that in that year the survival of a
free Vietnam and a free Vietnamese Government was still in grave
doubt; was that a correct statement?

"MR. DURBROW. Quite correct.

"SENATOR MANSFIELD. â€˜The stability of the government was threatened
by the Binh Xuyen, by dissident political-religious sects such

as the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai.

"There was a very substantial armed Communist Vietminh under-
ground in the south; is that correct?
