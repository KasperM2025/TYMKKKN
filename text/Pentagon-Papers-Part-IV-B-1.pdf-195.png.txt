DEPTEL 545 to Saigon, 4 November 1961. The language cited in the
footnote is the only completely unambiguous indication of how far
the U.S. hoped to go in putting Americans into a direct position

of influence in the Vietmamese government and army. But there is
plenty of language in the Taylor Mission Report that suggests as
much and there is a rather blunt statement, quoted at the end of
Section II of this chapter, which Nolting was told to pass on to
Diem in explaining the U.S. offer.

Sorenson, op. cit., p. 737, says senior advisors "on Vietnam," which
presumably did not include someone like George Ball, then Under-
secretary of State, who has been widely reported to have opposed
any combat troop commitments.

As we will see, Galbraith is also on record against troops. Rusk
is on record as deferring combat troops in a joint McNamara /Rusk
memorandum which appears to have been drafted after the President
had made his decision (it contradicts a memorandum McNamara signed
only three days earlier). We do not know whether Rusk, like
McNamara was reversing his position.
