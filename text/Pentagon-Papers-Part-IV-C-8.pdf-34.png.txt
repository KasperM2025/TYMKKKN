five villages was pushed back to April, 1966. The GVN and the Marines
considered their control to extend to over 16,000 of the 23,000 people
in the area, but, according to an Embassy evaluation of the area, only
682 were young men between the ages of 17 and 30. It was clear that
the Marines were trying to pacify an area in which the young men no
longer lived, having either been drafted, joined the VC, or gone to
Da Nang to work for the Americans. "The basic problem posed by this
Jack of manpower must be solved before the area can be expected to
participate in its own defense," the Embassy report said. "Until it
is solved, the Marines and the ARVN will remain tied to defensive
mission involving them with the population. No one in Quang Nam sees
any immediate solution to this dilemma." The report concluded with a
description of how over-involved with local politics the Marines were
becoming, unintentionally, and said: :

"The plan, despite the valiant efforts of the Marines,
is in trouble, caused by a confused and fragmented chain of
command, a lack of skilled cadre, inability to reeruit
locally RF and PF -- and the open opposition of the VNQDD." 33/

The VNQDD, or Vietnam Quoc Dan Dang, was the political party
controlling the provinces of Quang Ngai, Quang Nam, and Quang Tin.
The Marines knew little about them, although, according to the study,
all the village chiefs in the area were VINQDD members. The VNQDD
were not supporting the priority area plan because they had not been
consulted in its formulation, and for this reason, and others, the
report predicted the failure of the plan, despite the heavy Marine

commitment.
Like Hop Tac, it was en unusually difficult situation, but it

illustrates the problems that the Marines, and any other U.S. troops
that got deeply involved in pacification, confronted in Vietnam.
