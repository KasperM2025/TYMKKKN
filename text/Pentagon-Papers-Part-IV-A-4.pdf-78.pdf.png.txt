probably be mobilized without initially curtailing essential
economic activities. The Vietnamese Government would be
almost entirely dependent. upon foreign aid to support such a
force. â€˜

30. The Diem Government vroposes to expand the army to
200,000 by the end of 195k, end to 225,000 by the end of 1955.
By the letter date, the army would include 10 divisions plus
60 territorial battalions. The cost of maintaining these forces
through 1955 has been estimated at about $50,000,000 of which
almost all would have to be furnished by external assistance.
The French have supported this proposal as being required....
A proposal for development of a National Guard under the Ministry
of the Interior has been postponed pending the outcome of French-
Vietnemese-United Stetes discussions.

31. On the other hand, the United States is considering
the reduction of the Vietnamese army to about 80,000, including
3 combat light divisions. These reduced forces would have pri-
marily an internal security mission. Against a large-scale Viet
Minh invasion, they would serve only as a delaying force. Cost
of maintaining the forces at the reduced levels has been tenta-
tively estimated at ebout $200,000,000 per year. This estimated
cost is in eddition to financial, economic, and military support
funds, which might total $150, 000, 000 per year. 75/

Thus a listing of problems and deficiencies to be dealt with would
contain at least the following: force size; force structure; disengage-
ment of general steff from political affairs; planning of an internal
Security progrem; planning of a delaying strategy to counter invasion
from the north; correction of a spirit of insubordination and irresponsi-
bility; replacing French cadre; developing a self-reliant officer corps;
developing an independent logistics capability; developing adequate
technical services; development of training system and program; learning
about and coping with the problems of semi-military and police forces;
resolving the problem of the Netional Guard.

F. How did the U.S, go about altering the state of the VNA?

With the JCS-recommended force levels for Indochina forwarded to
Secretary of Defense on 22 November 1954, the unser bound of the regular
Vietnamese army force goals was establishea at 184,000; 76/ the teking
into account of the objections of Secretary of State, who regerded this
force level. as "excessive" to the mission of establishing end maintein-
ing internal security, T2/ set the lower-bound goal of approximately
88,000. The earliest U.S. actions toward the VNA were devoted to reduc-
ing- the VNA to this lower level while reorganizing the forces in order
to rectify as many as possible of the problens listed above.
