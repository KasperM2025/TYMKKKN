and ammunition depots and has caused a dispersal of supplies
and equipment. However, North Vietnam's air defense system
continues to function effectively despive increased attacks
on airfields, SAM sites, and AAA positions. The supply of
SAM missiles and antiaircraft ammunition appears adequate,
notwithstanding our heavy attacks, and we see no indication
of any permanent drop in their expenditure rates.

Our intensified air campaign against the transportation
system seriously disrupted normal operations and has increased
the cost and difficulties of maintaining traffic flows.

Losses of transportation equipment have increased, but inven-
tories have been maintained by imports from Communist countries.
The heavy damage inflicted on key railroad and highway bridges
in the Hanoi-Haiphong areas during 1967 has been largely off-
set by the construction of numerous bypasses and the more
extensive use of inland waterways.

While our overall loss rate over North Vietnam has been
decreasing steadily, from 3.4 aircraft per 1,000 sorties
in 1965 to 2.1 in 1966 and to 1.9 in 1967, losses over the
Hanoi-Haiphong areas have been relatively high.

The systematic air campaign against fixed economic and
military target systems leaves few strategically important
targets unstruck. Other than manpower, North Vietnam pro-
vides few direct resources to the war effort, which is sus-
tained primarily by the large imports from the Communist
countries. The agrarian nature of the economy precludes
an economic collapse as a result of the bombing. Moreover
while we can make it more costly in time and manpower, it
is difficult to conceive of any interdiction campaign that
would pinch off the flow of military supplies to the south
as long as combat requirements remain at anything like the
current low levels. 72/
