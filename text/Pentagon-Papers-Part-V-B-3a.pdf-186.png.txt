declaration of July 3, M. Laniel has assured U. S.
representatives of his determination to grant genuine.
independence to the Associated States without the strings
which have marked the previous grants of "independence".

He apparently envisages something very much like Dominion
status, retaining only such French authority and privileges
as may be agreed.

c. Fiscal Rehabilitation. Laniel conceives his pro-
ject for Indochina as an integral part of a new and
supreme effort by France to "put its house in order",

He plans to approach a balanced budget during CY 1954.
This will involve a cut in French military as well as
civil expense for that year. At the same time he conten~
plates a greater effort in Indochina. To do this he asks
the U. S. for additional assistance amounting to about
$400 million for FY 195%.

6. a. Attached are two tables showing (1) the financing
of the Indochina war in CY 1953 and as proposed for

CY 195%; and (2) U. S. aid for France and Indochina under
1953 program and 1954 appropriations. They contain

- tentative figures for 195%.

b. As the first table makes clear, under the proposed
"program, the United States would assume about 50 per cent
of the 1954 budgetary expenditures ($829 million out of
$1,676 million) and, if end-item aid is included, would
be carrying about 61 per cent of the total financing.

This would represent about two and one~third times the
‘amount of U. S. aid for CY 1953.

&. As shown by the second table, this program would
entail an increase of $403 million over the assistance
now planned for France ($1,266 million). Of the total
French military budget for both Indochina and NATO. the
presently planned U.S. aid, including end items, would
be 26 per cent; if the aid were increased as requested,
such U, Ss assistance, including end items, -would be 3}-
per cent of the total.

G. Finally, as the first table indicates, under the
program, the toval expenditures for Indochina for 1954,

including end items, would be $2,160 million as compared
with 91,700 for C¥ 1953.
