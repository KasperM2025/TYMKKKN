. MEMORANDUM

At a meeting with the President at the White House this after-
noon for the puipose of briefing the President on the recent NATO
Paris meeting and bilateral talks with the British and the French,
the President asked Secretary Dulles what the lrench views were on
the situation in Laos,

The Secretary replied that the French were very gravely concerned ~
about the situation there. He said that when he had met with
Prime Minister Rene iayer last evening just prior to departure from
Paris, M. Mayer had stated that the French needed more urgently the
loan of some C-119 aircraft to help them get tanks and heavy equip-
ment into Laos to assist in its defense. Having such equipment
might mean the difference between holding and losing Laos. M. Mayer
had envisaged U.S. Air Force personnel operating the aircrart during
the period of the loan,

The Secretary said to the President tnat such a procedure would
mean the sending of U.S. personnel on coribat missions in Indochina,
This, obviously, was a decision which would have repercussions and
would raise many problems, However, there vas an alternative,
which would be to lean the French the C-119's, which he understood
the Department of Defense was willing to do, and have civilian pilots
fly them. Following his return to Washington this morning, the
Secretary had made inquiry and had ascertained that there vere
pilots in Formosa who were not members of the U.S. armed forces
and who might well be able to carry out these missions, This
possibility was being explored on an urgent basis to see whether it
vould not be possible to have the aircraft loaned and the above-
mentioned personnel in Formosa operate them.
