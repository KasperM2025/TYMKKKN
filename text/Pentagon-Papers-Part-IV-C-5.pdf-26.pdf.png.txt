in arresting the deteriorating
situation against the VC and as an
assurance that the U.S. would he
ready to counter overt DRV or
Chicom action should such occur.

20 Apr Honolulu McNamara, McNaughton, W. Bundy,
Conference Taylor, Wheeler, Sharp and

Westmoreland reached concensus
that: (1) the DRV was unlikely
to quit in the next six months
and probably would only give up
because of VC "pain" in the

South rather than bomb damage

in the North; (2) RT was about
right but wouldn't do the job
alone; (3) best strategy would

be to break the DRV/VC will by
effectively denying them victory
and bringing about negotiations
through the enemy's impotence.
They proposed establishing four
brigade-sized enclaves, in addi-
tion to Da Nang - Hue/Phu Bai,

at Bien Hoa/Vung Tau (3 Army
battalions plus 1 GOA battalion);
Chu Lai (3 BLTs plus 3 Marine
TFS); Qui Nhon (3 Army battalions);
and Quang Ngai (3 ROK battalions).
Added on to the 4 USMC BLTs
(33,000 U.S. troops) and 2000

ROK troops already in Vietnam,

the total was to be 82,000 U.S.
and 7250 3d country troops.
Mentioned for possible later
deployment were: aU.S. Air-
mobile Division, a Corps Hq,

an ROK Div (-), and the remaind-
der of the III MEF (2 battalions).
It was agreed that ARVN and U.S.
units would be "brigaded"‚Äù for
operations, that the U.S. would
try single managers of U.S. effort
in 3 provinces as an experiment,
that MEDCAP would be expanded, .
and that a study of fringe bene-
fits for RVNAF would be undertaken.

21 Apr SecDef Memo McNamara sent the Honolulu ue
for recommendations to the President ae
