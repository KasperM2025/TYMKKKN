(a) On an interim basis, and within the funds al-
ready appropriated under the Mutual Defense Assistance
Act by the Congress for the fiscal year 1951, the Govern-
ment of the United States will make available in support
of the French Government's increased military production
program assistance in the amount of $200 million, those
funds to be obligated prior to June 30, 1951.

(ob) The final amount of American assistance to
support the expanded French defense effort will, subject
to future provision of funds by the Congress, be determined
on the basis of multi-lateral discussions within the
framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
directed toward an equitable distribution among all the
North Atlantic Treaty members of the economic burdens
of the common rearmament effort.
