3. While this message deals only with the increased advisory
effort at the battalion and district levels consideration is also
being given to increases at sector level, also discussed at Honolulu.
Those recommendations which will be submitted separately will not
approach the magnitude of the increases recommended in this message
for battalion and district levels....

5. Administrative and logistical support personnel and equip-
ment requirements will be studied separately. From our earlier
studies it is apparent that requirements will be significant.

6. An increase of approximately eighty (80) US Naval Advisors
will also be recommended. Chief US Naval Advisory Group, in coordina~
tion with CNO VNN, has identified areas in need of additional advisory
effort. I concur in the need and will support recommendation to be
submitted separately. 119/

UNRESOLVED ISSUES: SPEED AND DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY

The decision to increase the advisory effort in the magnitude and
fashion just cited had already been made in effect. It was necessary,
however, for the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense personally to
approve every manpower space for MACV or MAAG Vietnam -- not because such
decisions could not be delegated but because the Secretary chose to
reserve them to himself. 120/ The questions which remained were, first,
how much freedom to adjust numbers to situations (a discretionary authority
COMUSMACV had consistently requested) would be permitted and, second, the
rate at which the agreed expansion would take place. There could have
been other questions, of course: should the district advisory effort
spread in close geographic relation to the pacification plan or follow
some other scheme; should the advisors be conscious agents to increase
U.S. leverage or essentially technical-tactical assistants to their
counterparts; how deeply involved should advisors become in local polit-
ical administration? There is no indication Chat these and other related â€”
Questions of the advisors' role were brought "wp the tape" for examina-
tion. The principal issue was simply how quickly they should be brought
into South Vietnam and et what level discretionary authority would be
exercised.
