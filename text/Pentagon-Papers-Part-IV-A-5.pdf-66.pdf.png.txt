amount that required for replacement, and that, rather, the DRV
steadily modernized and expanded its forces during the decade after
Geneva. 85/ In the first six months after the truce alone, U.S.
intelligence reported that PAVN introduced from China, concealing
the movements from the ICC, more than 150 pieces of field and anti-
aircraft artillery, 500 mortars, 9,000 automatic weapons, 500
recoilless rifles, 400 military vehicles, and substantial amounts

of ammunition. 86/ Thereafter, the U.S. was convinced that regular
infusions of modern equipment from the CPR and the Soviet Union
supported extensive reorganization and growth of DRV armed forces.

According to U.S. estimates, the period 1954-1956 was
devoted to regrouping and reorganizing. .New divisions were formed,
incorporating Viet Minh from South Vietnam regrouped to the North per
the Geneva Agreements. Overage and unfit personnel were weeded out,
and intensive political indoctrination begun, Divisions were deployed
into the countryside, with the new southern formations concentrated in
areas of civil unrest. 88/ In 1957 and 1958 improvements in organiza-
tion and control were inaugurated, PAVN taking on the structure and
trappings of a Bloc-style professional army, with regularized pay scales,
insignia, rank, and the like. During 1958 and 1959, to meet goals for
manning collective farms, some divisions were reduced in personnel and
converted to brigades. Conscription was introduced, the Armed Public
Security Forces ~- frontier and internal security troops -- formed, and
the air and naval forces elevated in status. In 1960 and 1961 additional
divisions were reduced to brigades, but since diversions to agriculture
diminished, this was presumably to provide smaller, more manageable
formations for the infiltration then underway into Laos, and in prospect
for South Vietnam. In sum, with Bloc aid, the DRY more than doubled its
effective infantry divisions from 6 in 1954 to 14 by 1962. U.S. intel-
ligence credited the PAVN in 1954 with the capability, by concentrat ing
all its resources on a single objective, of mounting an attack of limited
duration using three divisions supported by direct artillery fire. By
1961, the U.S. rated the North Vietnam Army (NVA) as capable of a five
division offensive backed by substantially greater logistic and combat
support, including indirect artillery fires. 89/ The U.S. did not know
