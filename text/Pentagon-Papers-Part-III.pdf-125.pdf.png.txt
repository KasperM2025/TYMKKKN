In a talk with the Cambodian Foreign Minister Sam Sary, Philip Bonsal
suggested that it would not be possible to guarantee Cambodia's security
by a Conference mechanism subject to communist veto. Bonsal said, how-
ever, that once a satisfactory cease-fire were concluded, one that did

not prevent Cambodia from cooperating with other non-communist states

in defense matters, "he was confident U.S. and other interested countries
looked forward to discussing with Cambodian Government" the security
problem. (Johnson priority tel. SECTO 627 from Geneva, July 16, 1954,

pany of Nong Kimny (Ambassador to Washington), the Under Secretary
recommended that Phnom Penh, at the Conference, state its intention

not to have foreign bases on its territory and not to enter into mili-
tary alliances. At the same time, though, Cambodia would be free to
import arms and to employ French military instructors and technicians.
While Cambodia would thus perhaps not be free to join the contemplated
SFATO, she might still benefit from it. Smith "assured the Cambodian
Foreign Minister that, in our view, any aggression overt or covert against
Cambodian territory would bring pact into operation even though Cam-
bodia not a member. I took position that French Union membership afforded

- Cambodia adequate desirable means of securing through France necessary

arms, some of which would be American, as well as necessary instructors
and, technicians, some of which might well be American trained." Nong
Kimmy "limited himself to statement that Cambodia relies heavily on
U.S. for eventual protection against aggression and that Cambodia de-
sires to emerge from current conference with maximum freedom of action
re measures Cembodia may take to assure defense.‚Äù Smith tel. SECTO
