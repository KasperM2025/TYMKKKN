The Eisenhower Administration followed the basic policy of its
predecessor, but also deepened the American commitment to containment
in Asia. Secretary Dulles pursued a forthright, anti-communist policy
and made it clear that he would not permit the "loss" of Indochina,
in the manner the Democrats had allegedly allowed the "loss" of China.
Dulles warned China not to intervene, and urged the French to drive
toward a military victory. Dulles was opposed to a cease-fire and
tried to dissuade the French from negotiations with the Viet Minh until
they had markedly improved their bargaining position through action on
the battlefield. The NSC in early 1954 was persuaded that a non-
communist coalition regime would eventually turn the country over to
the Viet Minh. In consequence of this more militant policy, the U.S.
Government tended to focus on the military rather than the political
aspects of the French-Viet Minh struggle. (Tab 3)
