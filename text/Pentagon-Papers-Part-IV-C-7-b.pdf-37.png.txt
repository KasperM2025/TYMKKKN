The Memorandum went on to recommend what Roger Fisher
had been suggesting, namely concentrating strikes in the lower half
of NVN, without, however, turning the upper Lalf into a completely
forbidden sanctuary:

We therefore recommend that all of the sorties
allocated to the ROLLING THUNDER program be concentrated
on the lines of communications -- the "funnel" through
which men and supplies to the South must flow -- between
17-20° reserving the option and intention to strike (in the
20-30° area) as necessary to keep the enemy's investment in
defense and in repair crews high throughout the country. 83/

The proposed change in policy was not aimed at getting
NVN to change its behavior or to negotiate, and no favorable response
from Hanoi should be expected:

But to optimize the chances of a favorable Hanoi
reaction, the scenario should be (a) to inform the Soviets
quietly (on May 15) that within a few (5) days the policy
would be implemented, stating no time limits and making no
promises not to return to the Red River basin to attack
targets which later acquired military importance, and then
(b) to make an unhuckstered shift as predicted on May 20.
We would expect Moscow to pass the May 15 information on to
Hanoi, perhaps (but probably not) urging Hanoi to seize the
opportunity to de-escalate the war by talks or otherwise.
Hanoi, not having been asked a question by us and having no
ultimatum-like time limit, might be in a better posture to
react favorably than has been the case in the past. 8)/

The Memorandum recommended that the de-escalation be explained
as improving the military effectiveness of the bombing, in accordance
with the interdiction rationale:

Publicly, when the shift had become obvious (May 21
or 22), we should explain (a) that as we have always said,
the war must be won in the South, (b) that we have never said
pombing of the North would produce a settlement by breaking
Hanoi's will or by shutting off the flow of supplies, (c) that
the North must pay a price for its infiltration, (d) that the
major norjhern military targets have been destroyed, and (e)
that now we are concentrating on the narrow neck through
which supplies must flow, believing that the concentrated
effort there, as compared with a dispersed effort throughout
North Vietnam, under present circumstances will increase the
efficiency of our interdiction effort, and (f) that we may
have to return to targets further north if military consid- .
erations require it. 85/
