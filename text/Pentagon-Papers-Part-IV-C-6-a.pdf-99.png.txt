8. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BRING AS MASSIVE
WE CAN AND THAT We SHOULD
is ¢

ITARY FORCE TO BEAR VIET=NAM AS WE
oe ee ae ee ae Ne- SO: LONG aS H “AN BE DONE WITHOUT
A WILDCAT INFLATION AND WITHOUT OTHER LETHAL POLITICAL EFFECTS. I
BELIEVE THAT WHEN ONE HAS RECOURSE TO i FORCE, OVERWHELMING
STRENGTH BRINGS A QUICKER RESULT, A SHORTER WAR AND THUS FEWER
CASUALTIES.

9. THE POLITICAL AND INFLATIONARY DANGERS WHICH THE PRESENCE
OF TROOPS CREATES MUST BE CONSTANTLY oe “De WE HAVE, CLEARLY,
FOR EXAMPLE, ALREADY GONE TOO FAR IN PUTTING AMERICANS=IILITARY
OR CIVILIAN-- INTO VIETNAMESE COMMUNITIES, JOSTLING THE VIET-
NAMESE, SQUATTING ON AFTER LEASES HAVE EXPIRED, AND IN EFFECT
TELLING THEM TO MOVE OVER.

19. I UNE ERST AND THAT TODAY SGWE Gg PERCENT OF Wasa TROOPS ARE
ASSIGNE D UNOER THE GENERAL HEADING OF "GUARDING BASES” AND THAT
THE REMAINING 68 PERCENT IS ENGAGED IN SO-CALLED "GFFENSIVE
OPERAT IOVS" AGAINST MAIN FORCE UNITS. IT NOW APPEARS THAT
TROOPS ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED FOR AN ENTIRELY NEW KIND OF
WORK--THAT IS CONTAINMENT OF THE SANCTUARIES" IN COUNTRIES
ADJACENT TO VIET=NAM HICH ARE BECOVING VERY BIG. THE

TROOPS ENGAGED IN SUCH WORK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY UNPOPULATED
COUNTRY AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE SERIOUS POLITICAL CONSEQUENCE.
11. IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, TROOPS ARE STATIONED IN THE DELTA,
WHICH 1S BOTH THICKLY POPULATED AND A GREAT RICE PRODUCING
COUNTRY, THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DANGERS COULD BE GREAT.
THESE THINGS CANNOT BE FORETOLD AHEAD OF TIME AND MUST BE
WATCHED ON A DAILY SASIS.

De RECOMMENDATIONS

Be TURNINS NOY TO THE CIVIL SIDE, | FEEL IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT
USAID EXPENDITURES a 1866 ARE 725 BILLION AND | VELIEVE WE
COULD DO THE ABSOLUTELY VITAL TPINGS IN 1967 WITH S$ PS
AROUND THAT AMOUNT. THES IS BECAUSE OF MY BELIEF,

REGARIS CIVIL EXPENDITURES, THAT THE PROBLEM IS oS 2 MUCH
ODO MORE AS IT IS TO DO WHAT WE DO BETTER AND MORE SKILL
FULLY, THEREBY DEVELOPING AND ENCOURAGING VIETNAMESE SELF

HELP AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT. INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE 7956 LEVEL
OF 7-6, 1 PROPOSE AN INCREASE OF UP TO 16. WITH OTHER CIVILIAN
EXPENDITURES | THUS PROPOSE AN OVERALL CIVILIAN CEILING OF 16
BILLION PIASTERS. HAVING IN MINO THE FACT THAT IN THIS PAINFUL
CONTEMPLATION THE IMMOVEABLE FORCE 1S UP AGAINST THE IRRESIST~
IBLE OBJECT, | BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE BEST THING TO 00 -
DIFFICULT THOUGH IT IS.

B. THE UeSe MILITARY IS THUS ASSIGNED A CEILING OF 42

BILLION PIASTERS FOR 1967. 1P1S PROPOSED MILITARY CEILING OF
42 BILLION PIASTERS IS 12 BILLION HIGHER THAN THE SPENDING LEVEL
FOR 1966. IT CONSTITUTES AN INCREASE OF 9 BILLION PIASTERS ABOVE
THE FIRST STAFF STUDY RECOMMENDATION OF 33 BILLION. IT RE=
PRESENTS AN UNCREASE OF 3 BILLION ABOVE THE SECOND STAFF STUDY.
TPE LEVEL OF 42 BILLION PIASTERS APPEARS TO VE REASONABLE IN
