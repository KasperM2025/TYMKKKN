The Secretary believed continuance of: substantial
economic aid to France will have to take the form of
assistance to the prosecution of the Indochina war
under some kind of program which our military people can
tell our Congress seems to make sense and holds promise
of a satisfactory outcome, perhaps in a couple of years.

The JCS had reported that the reaction from French
visits to Korea was not very satisfactory, that nothing
we were doing there could be used. We were not surprised
about that initial reaction because it took our own
people in Korea a very long time to realize the capabilities
of the South Koreans. There is a tendency to minimize
those capabilities. The problem is to some extent politi-
cal as well as military. For instance, while decisions
at a high level are taken in Paris regarding the Associated
States, implementation or interpretation in the local
light may be in a different spirit, in a community which
has soâ€˜long been in colonial status and where certain
relations have been established between white and
colored people. For instance, social relations mey
be lacking and some people not admitted to certain clubs,
As far as implementating those decisions in the field
is concerned, and the relations with the local people,
we realize that we have a similar problem in our south
for which we have not always found a solution.
