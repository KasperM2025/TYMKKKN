~ THES CHANCE FOR PEACE
Address by the President!
White House press release dated April 16

Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet
Union. Its links to the past, however strong, cannot
bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its
own to make.

. . * . . . . *

-.a world that begins to witness the rebirth of
trust among nations can find its way to a peace that is
neither partial nor punitive.

With all who will work in good faith toward such
a peace, we are ready, with renewed resolve, to strive
to redeem the near-lost hopes of our day.

The first great step along this way must be the
conclusion of an honorable armistice in Korea.

This means the immediate cessation of hostilities
and the prompt initiation of political discussions
leading to the holding of free elections in a united Korea.

It should mean, no less importantly, an end to the
direct and indirect attacxs upon the security of Indo-
ehina and Malaya. For any armistice in Korea that merely
released aggressive armies to attack elsewhere would
be a fraud.

We seek, throughout Asia as throughout the world,
@ peace that is true and total.

Out of this can grow a still wider task--the
achieving of just political settlements for the other
serious and specific issues between the free world
and the Soviet Union.
