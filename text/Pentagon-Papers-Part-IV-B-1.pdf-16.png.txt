Kennedy Decisions on
the Draft Report

NSC Meets; New Draft
of the Task Force
Report Issued

DESCRIPITON

views were rejected in favor of
Black's second paper which advo-
cated more ARVN troops -- to
counter overt aggression, not in-
ereased infiltration -- and com-
mitment of US troops for training
purposes -- not for political
reassurance or demonstration of
US resolve. Black's second paper
was sent to the NSC.)

Kennedy did not act on the Laos
Annex. He approved only the
limited military proposals con-_
tained. in the first Gilpatric Task
Foree report. The 685-man MAAG
would be increased to 785 to enable
it to train the approved 20,000 new
ARVN troops. Kennedy also author-
ized the MAAG to support and advise
the Self Defense Corps (40,000 men);
authorized MAP support for the entire
Civil Guard of 68,000 (vice 32,000
previously supported); ordered in-
stallation of radar surveillance

‘equipment and okayed MAP support

and training for the Vietnamese
Junk Force.

Kennedy again deferred decision on
sending troops into Laos apparently
because the feeling that the US would
not make such a move was now firm.

The 1 May draft report was. little

. different from the 28 April version.

The Laos Annex was incorporated into
the main paper; the US was to make
known its readiness to “intervene
unilaterally" in Southeast Asia to
fulfill SEATO commitments (vice
intervene in conjunction with SEATO
forces). ARVN increases were now
justified by the threat of overt
aggression as well as increased in-
filtration.
