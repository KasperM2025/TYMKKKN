Conference's "subversion" through communist intransigence; yet when,
in mid-June, the Conference began to break for what would be a lengthy
recess, Washington had to conclude that united action was no longer
appropriate to military circumstances in Indochina, nor feasible given
U.S. insistence on intervention only under conditions conducive to a
decisive success. By the end of June, therefore, the pattern of U.S.
diplomacy shifted -- from united action in Indochina to collective
defense in Southeast Asia, and from disenchantment with the Geneva
Conference to attempts to influence a settlement at least basically

in keeping with our interests.
