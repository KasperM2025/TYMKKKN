"Viet-Nem's very success as well as its potential wealth and its
strategic location have led the Communists of Hanoi, goaded by the
bitterness of their failure to enslave all Viet-Nem, to use increasing
violence in their attempts to destroy your country's freedom.

â€œMis grave threat, added to the strains and fatigues of the long
struggle to achieve ard strengthen independence, must be a burden that
would cause moments of tension and concern in almost any human heart.
Yet from long observation I sense how deeply the Vietnamese value their
country's independence and strength and I know how well you used your
boldness when you led your countrymen in winning it. I also know that
your determination has been 4 vital factor in guarding that independence
while steadily advancing the economic development of your country. I am
confident that these same qualities of determination and boldness will
meet the renewed threat as well as the needs and desires of your country-
men for further progress on all fronts.

"Although the main responsibility for guarding that independence
will always, as it has in the past, belong to the Vietnamese people and
their government, I want to assure you that for so long as our strength
can be useful, the United States will continue to assist Viet-Nam in the
difficult yet hopeful struggle ahead.

"Sincerely,

"DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER."
