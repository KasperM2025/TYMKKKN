As they continued, however, they fed a fear which was becoming
predominent in the administration, that increases in forces might
tempt COMUSMACV and our SEA commanders to expand operations into
Cambodia and Laos, thereby complicating an already sensitive political
situation:

b. It may ultimately become necessary to conduct
military operations into Cambodia to deny the Viet Cong/
North Vietnamese Army forces the psychological, military,
and logistical advantages of this sanctuary. Should the
Viet Cong/North Vietnamese forces increase their use of
the Laos Panhandle, it might become necessary to deploy
additional forces to Thailand and expand operations further
to protect South Vietnam. To counter large-scale CHICOM
overt intervention in northern Laos, it would be necessary
to establish a strategic defense. Invocation of the SEATO
Treaty would be indicated. In the event the CHICOMs attack
Thailand, use of nuclear weapons against LOCs and supply
bases in southern China might be required. Similarly,
should the CHICOMs intervene overtly with major combat

- forces in Vietnam, it might be necessary to establish a
strategic defense in South Vietnam and use tactical nuclear
weapons against bases and LOCs in South China. 11/

3. ‘The Vance Options--Re-examination of Increases

On 24 May the JCS submitted’ to the Secretary of Defense their study
entitled, "Alternative Courses of Action for Southeast Asia." This
study was in response to a request made on 26 April by Deputy Secretary
Vance asking the Joint Chiefs to study in detail the two alternative
courses Of action, outlined in the State paper prepared earlier by
Acting Secretary of State Katzenbach. i2/ Strangely enough, between
the time of the 26 April memorandum from Deputy Secretary Vance to the
Director of the Joint Staff, Course A was altered, changing in the JCS
paper from 200,000 personnel to approximately 250,000," roughly 125,000
in FY 68 and another 125,000 in FY 69. In the JCS study this was
described as the "optimum force outlined in JCSM 218-67 and includes
a 4-2/3 division force." Course B as it was outlined in the original
Katzenbach memo confined troop increases to "those than can be generated
without calling up reserves -- perhaps 9 battalions (10,000) men in
the next year." 13 This figure was altered in the JCS study so that
Course B read: ‘add only forces that can be generated without calling
up Reserves. This will amount to approximately 70,000 in FY 68 to
include 1-1/3 Army division force equivalents with a limited capability

in FY 69." 14/
Course A which would necessitate a Reserve call-up and a 12-month

involuntary extension in terms of service effective 1 Jun 67 was esti-
mated to cost $12.1 billion through FY 69, as compared to $7.7 billion
