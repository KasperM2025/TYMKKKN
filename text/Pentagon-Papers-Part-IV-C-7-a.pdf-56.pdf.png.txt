McNamara and McNaughton were optimistic that, by skill-
ful diplomacy, this pitfall could be avoided. Rusk, Bundy and Johnson,
who had to perform the required diplomatic task, and the Chiefs, who
were professionally distrustful of the diplomatic art and of the ability
of the political decision-makers in Washington to resist the pressures
from the "peace movement" in the United States, were not so sure. The
Chiefs (echoing General Westmoreland and Admiral Sharp) were also opposed
to any measures which would, even momentarily, reduce the pressure on
North Vietnam. The arguments for and against a pause were summarized
in a State Department memorandum to the President on 9 November:

The purposes of -- and Secretary McNamara's arguments
for -- such a pause are four:

(a) It would offer Hanoi and the Viet Cong a chance
to move toward a solution if they should be so inclined,
removing the psychological barrier of continued bombing
and permitting the Soviets and others to bring moderating
arguments to bear;

(b) It would demonstrate to domestic and inter-
national critics that we had indeed made every effort for
a peaceful settlement before proceeding to intensified
actions, notably the latter stages of the extrapolated
Rolling Thunder program;

(ec) It would probably tend to reduce the dangers of
escalation after we had resumed the bombing, at least inso-
far as the Soviets were concerned;

(a) It would set the stage for another pause, per-
haps in late 1966, which might produce a settlement.

Against these propositions, there are the following
considerations arguing against a pause:

(a) In the absence of any indication from Hanoi as
+o what reciprocal action it might take, we could well
find ourselves in the position of having played this very
important ecard without receiving anything substantial in
return. There are no indications that Hanoi is yet in a
moud to agree to a settlement acceptabâ€™e to us. The chance
is, therefore, very slight that a pause at this time could
lead to an acceptable settlement.

(b) A unilateral pause at this time would offer an
excellent opportunity for Hanoi to interpose obstacles to
our resumption of bombing and to demoralize South Vietnam
