A Director's Memorandum to the Acting Chairman, in response to this
inquiry, was forwarded on 9 September. This Memorandum indicated that
the refined Program 5 troop list then being developed by the Joint Staff
indicated that a total of 62,132 Program 5 forces had not been ordered
deployed as of that date. Of these, approximately 9% were scheduled
to be deployed in Calendar Year 67, 35% to be deployed 1 January to
1 March 1968, and the remainder scheduled to be deployed after 1 March.
Most of the forces scheduled to deploy in FY 1969 were controlled by
long lead time equipment and were not subject to acceleration into the
January-February 1968 time frame. A hurried analysis, however, indicated
that about 1,700 Navy personnel, scheduled to deploy after 1 March, might
be accelerated to January-February 1968 deployments. Since neither the
Air Force nor the Marines had an appreciable number scheduled to deploy
after 1 March 1968, the fruitful area for further exploration quickly
turned to the Army capability for accelerating deployment.. The bulk of
the Army combatant units was scheduled to deploy in February-March 1968.
These included the 101st Airborne Division (-), and the llth Light
Infantry Brigade in February 1968, and 4 separate infantry battalions in
March 1968.

The Army indicated that 1 brigade task force plus the division head-
quarters, approximately 4,500 personnel, of the 10lst Airborne Division (-),
could, in fact, be accelerated to arrive in-country by 15 December 1967,
and the remainder of the division (-), approximately 5,500 personnel,
could be accelerated to arrive in-country on 31 January 1968, under the
following conditions:

a. Movement by air would be required and would cost $15M
more than movement by surface;

b. Non-divisional support units which were planned to accompany
the division could not be accelerated; therefore the support must be pro-
vided by in-country resources.

e. Additional unit training in-country of approximately four
weeks would be required before the units would be fully combat ready.

The llth Light Infantry Brigade could be accelerated for arrival
in-country by 31 January 1968, if it were to be deployed by air.

The Director's memorandum listed several possible actions to be
explored with the Services which might speed up Program 5 ee.
Among these were:

: 1. Delay commencement of civilianization program until
after 1 March 1968. Thereafter use personnel released
by civilianization for fill of skeleton units or for
in-country activation of new units.
