The import of Secretary Acheson's statement of February 1 is made
clear by the first paragraph of the Department of State press
release of that date: "The recognition by the Kremlin of Ho Chi
Minh's communist movement in Indochina comes as a surprise. The
Soviet acknowledgment of this movement should remove any illusions
as to the 'nationalist' nature of Ho Chi Minh's aims and reveals
teas hes true colors as the mortal enemy of independence in Indo-
Chama ar.

As President Truman was later to write concerning his view of Chi-
nese operations in November 1950, "The situation in Korea...was
not the only instance of a new aggressiveness on the part of Com-
munist China. There was evidence that the communist rebel forces
in Indochina were receiving increasing aid from Peiping. Also,
in the last days of October, Communist China had moved against the

â€˜ ancient theocracy of Tibet. We were seeing a pattern in Indochina

and Tibet timed to coincide with the attack in Korea as a challenge
to the Western world." Memoirs of Harry S. Truman, Volume 2, p. 380.

On May 3, 1949, General Chennault told two Congressional Committees
that unless the U.S. took immediate steps to save the Nationalists,
all Asia would fall to the communists.
