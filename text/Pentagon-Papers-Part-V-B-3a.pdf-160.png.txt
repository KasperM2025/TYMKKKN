ANNEX 2

Yext of the French Memorandum

———$ a eee

Ls One of the essential aims of the free world

is the containment of Communist expansion in the Far

East. France is not defending her own interests alone

in Indo-China any more than the United States is defending
solely its own interests in Korea.

Sis From the juridicial point of view, there is no
connection between the Korean War waged by the United
Nations and the war in Indo-China waged by France and

the Associated States. But on the Allied side it has
often been ascertained by the highest military and
political authorities, that the Far East, on a line
stretching from Korea to Malaya through Indo-China,
constitutes a single front, divided into several theatres
of operations.

Je It is therefore logical that nations which
have waged or which continue to wage the same battle
separately be united in the pursuit of peace, just as
they have helped and still help one another in war.

yy, conversely, it would be absurd that the con-~
clusion 6f an armistice in Korea, fervently desired by
the French Government as well as by all other members
of the United Nations, should have as a consequence an
increase.in the support lent by Communist China to the
Vietminh. The mission of the United Nations would not
be fulfilled if the cease-fire in North Asia should
result in an intensification of the war in South Asia.

oe Without being in a position to state that the
prospect of a truce in Korea is the cause, the French
Government notes at this very moment, with great concern,
that the supply of war material and articles of all sorts
to the Vietminh by:-Communist China has considerably in-
creased during the past three months. It is to be

feared that this state of affairs is going to deterio-
rate further during the months to come.
