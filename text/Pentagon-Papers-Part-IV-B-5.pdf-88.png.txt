with the strength of character of Diem, at least in fighting
communists. Certainly there are no Generals qualified to
take over in my opinion.

T em not a Diem man per se. I certainly see the faults
â€˜in his character. I am here to back 14 million SVN people in
their leader at this time.

I would suggest we not try to change horses too quickly.
That we continue to take persuasive actions that will make
the horses change their course and methods of action. That
we win the military effort as quickly as possible, then let
them make any and @11 the changes they want.

After all, rightly or wrongly, we have backed Diem for
eight long hard years. To me it seems incongruous now to get
him down, kick him around, and get rid of him. The US has

affair, short of revealing it to the palace.

We must, of course, get best possible estimate of chance
of coup's success and this estimate must color our thinking,
but do not think we have the power to delay or discourage 4
coup. Don has made it clear many times that this is a Viet-
nemese affair. It is theoretically possible for us to turn
over the information which has been given to vs in confidence
to Diem and this would undoubtedly stop the coup and would
make traitors out of us, For practical purposes therefore I
