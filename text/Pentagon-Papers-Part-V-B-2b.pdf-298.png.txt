Re DEPTEL 1141; December =,

The Frenc: have not (rpt not) asked for additional aircraft, What
they do request and General Trapnell is urgently recommending is
that the 30 F-8's already programmed be expedited to arrive here
not (rpt not) later than January atid that delivery of the 8 B-26ts
scheduled to arrive at rate of one a month during calendar year
1953 be accelerated. :

The French yesterday made, however, urgent request on which in
Trapnell's and my opinion imnediately favorable action in some form
or other should be teken., The request is that 150 American Air Force
mechanics be detailed immediately to Nnatrang Air Base for one

month to give 50-hour checks to 18 C-l7's and 100 hour checks on
another 18 c-47's. Nnatrang was chosen presumably because presence
mechanics would be less conspicuous than if detailed to at Tonkin
base or to Saigon. The French have made the same imperative request
of the French Air Ministry, but according local information, French
Metropolitan Air Force has only a few if any surplus mechanics for
immediate despatch, The French request is enti:ely legitimate,

When Salan asked for and was granted the 50 additional C-l7's late

ob eee, is MATIOR
