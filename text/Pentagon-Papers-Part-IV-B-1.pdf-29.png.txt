DATE EVENT OR DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION
5 Nov 1961 SNIE 10-)-61 This estimated the DRV, would re-

spond to an increased U.S. troop
commitment by increasing support

to the Vietcong. If U.S. comnit-
ment to the GVN grew, so would DRV
support to the VC. Four possible
U.S. courses were given: airlift
plus more help for ARVN; deployment
of 8-10,000 troops as a flood relief
task force; deployment of 25-0,000
combat troops; with each course,
warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to
hold SVN and U.S, intention to bomb
the DRV if its support for the VC
did not cease. The SNIE estimated
air attacks egeinst the North would
not cause its VC support to stop
and figured Moscow and Peking would
react strongly to air attacks, —

8 Nov 1961 McNamara Memoranda Secretary McNamara, Gilpetric and

for the President the JCS were “inclined to recommend
that we do commit the U.S. to the
clear objective of preventing the
fall of South Vietnam to communism
and that we support this commitment
by the necessary military actions."
The memorandum said the fall of
Vietnem would create "extremely
serious" strategic implications
worldwide, that chances were "probably
sharply against" preventing that fall
without a U.S. troop commitment but
that even with major troop deployment
(205,000 was the maximum number of
ground forces estimated necessary to
deal with a large overt invasion fron
the. DRV and/or China) the U.S. would
still be at the mercy of external
forces -~ Diem, Laos, domestic politi-
cal problems, etc. -- and thus success
could not be guarenteed. Mellamara,
recommended against deployment of a4
task force (the 8,000-man group
mentioned in the Taylor Report)
"mless we are willing to make an
affirmative decision" to full support
a commitment to save South Vietnem,
