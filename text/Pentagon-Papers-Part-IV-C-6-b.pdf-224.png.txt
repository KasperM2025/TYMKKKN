squadrons in Thailand, five additional destroyers and two battleships
and two cruisers for naval gunfire support. Although these forces
were not specifically addressed in the latest JCSM 416-67, Enthoven
recommended that they be addressed at that time. Accordingly, he
recommended that the TFS recommended by the JCS be unfavorably con-
sidered since he felt it would not contribute significantly to our
effort in Southeast Asia and that one battleship be authorized and
that other than that the increments in JCSM 218-67 be disapproved.
These recommendations were approved by Secretary McNamara in a memoran-
dum for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, dated 10 August. In it,

he wrote:

I tentatively approve for planning the forces as recom-
mended for SVN in the enclosure to JCSM 416-67 dated July 20,
1967 except for those units and augmentations listed in the
enclosure, pending submission of adequate justification.

The 9th MAB, the rotational APB, and tactical air squadrons
ready for deployment will be included in the 525,000 SVN
U.S. strength ceiling. Deployment authority for the two
VMA/VMFA Marine squadrons will be considered separately.

The table below summarizes the epproved force levels.

I recognize that the FY 68 troop list has not been
refined. In order to provide for timely budget actions,
please submit for my detailed review your refined troop
list, with detailed justification by September 15, 1967.
Your submission should inelude a monthly schedule of
civilianization/tradeoffs, identified by unit and Service,
in order to insure that U.S. forces in SVN do not exceed
525,000. For planning purposes, Program #5 will reflect
a total civilianization, trade-off schedule as follows:
