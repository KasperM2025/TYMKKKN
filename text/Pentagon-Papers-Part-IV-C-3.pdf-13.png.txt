DESCRIPTION

Taking note of the continued politi-
cal deterioration in SVN, Bundy con-
cludes that, Â«ven though it will get
worse, the US should probably pro-
ceed with Phese IIT of the December
pressures plan, the escalating air

strikes against the North.

South Korea sends 2,000 militery
advisors to SVN, the first such non-

US support.

General Khanh ousts the civilian
government headed by Huong and
assumes powers of government himself.

McNaughton is es pessimistic as
William Bundy about prospects in the
South. He feels the US should evacu-
ate dependents and respond promotly
at the newt reprisal opportunity.
McNeamara's pencilled ncetes reveal
more optimism about the results of
air strikes than McNaughton.

A resumption of the DESOTO Patrols
on or about 3 February is euthorized.

The JCS urge egain that a strong
reprisal action be taken immediately
after the next DRV/VC provocation.
In particular, they propose targets
and readiness to strike should the
forthcoming resumption of the DESOTO
Patrols be challenged.

In view of Kosygin's impending visit

to Hanoi, authority for the DESOTO
Patrol is cancelled.
