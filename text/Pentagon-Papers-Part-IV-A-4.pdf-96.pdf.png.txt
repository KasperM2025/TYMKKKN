28 with reference to the question of training Vietnamese forces the

Joint Chiefs' of Staff desire to point out that in addition to the current
unstable political situation in Vietnam the terms of the Geneva Armistice
Agreement have been-interpreted to limit the strength of MAAG, Indochina

to 342 personnel. Even if all these military personnel were replaced by U.S.
civilians to perform the normal functions of the MAAG and the military personnel
were thereby released for training duties only, the number of U.S. personnel
would permit only limited participation in the over-all training program.

Under these conditions, U.S. participation in training not only would probably
have but limited beneficial effect but also would assure responsibility for any
failure of the program." (Italics added). Memorandum for SECDEF from JCS,
Development and Training of Indigenous Forces in Indochina," 19 October 1954 (TS)
