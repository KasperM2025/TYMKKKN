4, The Counterinsurgency Plan (CIP)

The expectations of the Department of Defense for the
amelioration of Diem's security situation, as well as those of State
and the Embassy, were embodied in a Counterinsurgency Plan for
Vietnam (CIP), prepared over the months April to December 1960, and
forwarded to Washington for approval on 4 January 1961 (Saigon despatch
276, date cited). The CIP represented a considerable evolution in the
U.S. concepts of how to cope with Vietnam's internal security. During
1959 and early 1960, Diem, recognizing the precariousness of his
position, had begun to experiment with the structure of his security
forces, seeking to find a mix of police, paramilitary, and regular
military forces capable of countering the Viet Cong. The U.S. MAAG,
Vietnam, though constantly handicapped by personnel ceilings imposed
out of respect for the Geneva Accords, had labored to build a modern
national army, capable of both delaying invading forces from North
Vietnam and of coping with internal threats; in the pre-1960 MAAG

% The MAAG "Country Statements" for the period 1956-1960 record a
concentration on developing the staff and logistic superstructure of
ARVN, and on U.S. Army-type training programs; throughout, it is clear
that the MAAG looked increasingly to the Self Defense Corps, the

Civil Guard, and the National Police to meet the "Viet Minh" internal
threat in order to free ARVN for conventional combat training. See
