deploying additional forces to Southeast Asia, and requesting & congressional
resolution were held in abeyance pending that meeting.

One of the kinds of developments which the ExCom thought would necessi-
tate a flexible approach to its proposed action sequence occurred prior
to the Honolulu meeting. Its effect was to remove some of the "crisis
management" pressure from further policy deliberations. On 27 May, the
Polish Government proposed a conference format for laos that avoided many
of the undesirable features of the Geneva proposals which had been supported.
by communist governments in the past. After two days of deliberations,
during which time Secretary Rusk departed for Nehru's funeral in New Delhi,
a policy group composed, of several ExCom members determined that the United
States should attempt initially "to treat /the/ lao question separately
from /the/ _SVIN-NVN problem." Reasoning that era] satisfactory Lao
solution [were] not achieved, [a/ basis should have been laid for possi-
ble subsequent actions that would permit our dealing more effectively with
NVN with respect /to/ both SVN and Laos," the group decided to recommend.
to the President that he accept the Polish proposal. Integral to the ap-
proach would be a "clear expression of U.S. determination...that U.S. [iss
not willing /to/ write off Laos to /the/ communists," and assurances to
Souvanna. Phouma "that we would be prepared to give_him prompt and direct
military support if the Polish Conference was /sic/ not successful." g1/
With respect to our larger objectives in Southeast Asia, the proposed. dis-
cussions among representatives of Laos, the I.C.C. and the Geneva co-
chairmen would have the advantage of permitting Souvanna to continue to
insist upon his preconditions for any resumed 14-nation conference, and
would avoid the issue of Vietnam. ,
