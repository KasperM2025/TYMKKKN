burden of inflation falls most heavily on just those
Vietnamese -- the ARVN and GVN civil servants --

upon whose efficient performance our success most
heavily depends. Unless we rigidly control inflation,
the Vietnamese Army desertion rate will increase further
and effectiveness will decline, thus at least partially
cancelling the effects of increased U.S. deployments.
Further, government employees will leave their jobs and
civil strife will occur, seriously hindering both the
military and the pacification efforts and possibly even
collapsing the GVN.

For these reasons we must fit our deployments to the
capacity of the Vietnamese economy to bear them without
undue inflation. As your memorandwn indicates, the
program you recommend would cost over P46 billion in
CY 1967 at current prices. I believe implementation of
a program of this size would be self-defeating. The plan
I am approving at this time for budgetary planning appear
to me to be the maximum consistent with my reasonable
hope of economic stability. If contingencies arise during
the year, we can re-examine the plan accordingly. I plan
to provide sufficient combat-ready forces in the U.S. to
meet reasonable contingencies,

A troop list containing each unit in Program #4 is
attached. You may wish to suggest changes in the unit
mix, if there are units that have been deleted that have
a higher priority than those I have approved. I would
like to have these recommendations by December 1, 1966.
I also would like your proposals as to ways in which
approved units can be accelerated so as to provide maxi-
mum combat capability as early as possible in CY 1967.
