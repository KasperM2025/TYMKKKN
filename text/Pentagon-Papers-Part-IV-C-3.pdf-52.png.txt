into three attack options, consisting respectively of three, five, and
seven specified targets, and to plan to conduct the air strikes against
them, as directed, by option or by target, in any combination. The
options and targ:ts, together with estimated sorties, were as follows:

: Strike Flak CAP TOTAL
Option One

; Totals <.. 180 64 38 282

Of these seven targets, six were south of the 19th parallel, and on the
November working group's reprisal target list; one, the Thanh Hoa Bridge,
Target â€˜14 in Option Three, was north of the 19th parallel.

The strikes against these targets were to employ the US forces then
in mainland Southeast Asia in their alerted and augmented state (with an
additional F105 squadron from the Philippines at Da Nang), plus up to
3 CVAs; but they would also provide for strikes from a non-alert status,
i.e., with US forces normally in-country, plus CVA normally on station. 2
Strikes from a non-alert status, if ordered, would be simultaneous, ;
launched within the minimum feasible reaction time, and as near as prac-
ticable to first light following the reprisal incident. CINCPAC was also
asked to make "preliminary provisions" for a strike at Target 32-- Vu Con
Barracks in Option Two above -- to be conducted by VNAF, with assistance
from US flak suppression, CAP, pathfinder, and SAR. These provisions were
not to be revealed to the GVN at that time, since the inclusion of this
VNAF strike might or might not be ordered, depending on the circumstances .30/

CINCPAC responded the following day by issuing Operation Order
FLAMING DART, directing its Air Force and Navy Component Commands to be
prepared to conduct air strikes when directed, against the above targets
by option, or against any combination of the above targets within or
between options, in retalietion for attacks on the DESOTO Patrol.
