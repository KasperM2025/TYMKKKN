Bundy "Scenario for
Possible Resumption"

JCSM-41-66

McNaughton draft, "Some
Observations about
Bombing..."

MeNamara, memo to the
President

CINCPAC, dissenting from the
pause from the outset, argues
for the resumption of the
bombing promptly.

Westmoreland argues that
"immediate resumption is
essential."

Estimates that neither the
Soviets nor Chinese will actively
intervene in the war if the POL
system is attacked.

Admiral Sharp urges that the
bombing be resumed at sub-
stantially higher levels
immediately.

Bundy urges that the resumption
be at a low level building up
again gradually before major
new targets like POL are struck.

",..offensive air operations
against NVN should be resumed

now with a sharp blow and there-
after maintained with uninter-
rupted, increasing pressure."
Specifically, the Chiefs called
for immediate mining of the ports.

Purposes of the bombing are
(1) to interdict infiltration;
(2) to bring about negotiation;
(3) to provide a bargaining
counter; and (4) to sustain
GVN morale.

McNamara, drawing on the
language of MeNaughton's
earlier memo, recommends
resumption with sorties to
rise gradually to 4,000 per
month and stabilize. Promises
are all cautious.
