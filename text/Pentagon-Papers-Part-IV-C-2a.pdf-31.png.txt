DESCRIPTION

U.S. readiness and intent to move
up the scale if NVN did not reduce
insurgent support. Up the scale
meant moving from demonstrative
strikes to attecks against a sig-
nificant part of the DRV military
target system and ultimately, to
massive attacks against all signi-
ficant military targets in NVN.

By destroying them the U.S would
destroy NVN's capacity to support
insurgency.

Called for a Congressional Resolu-
tion right away to demonstrate

U.S. resolve (especially to Souvanna
and Khanh) and provide flexibility
for executive action.

One subject was made the agenda for
final talks about a Congressional
Resolution: actions still open to
the U.S. if both major military
operations and a Congressional
Resolution are rejected at this
time. White House guidance indi-
eated that by taking limited mili-
tary and political actions, the
U.S. could demonstrate firm resis-
tance without risking major escala-~.
tion or loss of policy flexibility.

McGeorge Bundy suggested these
possible limited actions, military:
reconnaissance, strike, T-28 opera-
tions in all of Laos; small-scale
reconnaissance strikes -- after
appropriate provocation -~- in NVN; -
VNAF strikes in Laotian corridors;
limited air and sea, more limited
ground deployments. (Bundy said
major ground force deployments seem
more questionable without a decision
"to go north" in some form.) Po-
litical: “Higher authority” wants

a maximum effort to increase allied
real and visible presence in support
