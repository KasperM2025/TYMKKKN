Re APF story February 17 Cannes that Bao Dai had postponed departure
Hong Kong for indefinite period, usually reliable Vietnamese source
gives following summary recent events.

At Bai dalong conference December with Bollaert, Bao Dai signed accord
of two articles: (1) France recognizes independence and unity Vietnam;
(2) once independent, Vietnam will freely adhere to French union. When
General Xuan, Tran Van ly, and Diem (who according this source continues
as "eminence grise" Nationalist) met Bao Dai Hong Kong after Bai dalong
conference, Diem persuaded Bao Dai signature of above accord was tacti-
cal error, that Vietnam should only bind itself to France by alliance,
not French union. (To what extent this position taken for bargaining
purposes not Clear). Finally decided best method of allowing Bao Dai
withdraw gracefully from commitment was to take position he signed only
as individual, not for his people, then have "assembly of notables"
call for his return Indochina as emperor of state freely allied with
France.

This strategy now being applied. Bao Dai, who anticipated failure
Geneva conversations, intends for present to remain France where he
can deal directly with Bidavlt, Schumen in preference Bollaert. Mean~
