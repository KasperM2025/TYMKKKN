destiny which he had authorized. It represents perhaps our best insight
into the President's understanding and motivation in the war, as well
as his hopes and dreams:

One day, my fellow citizens, there will be peace in
Southeast Asia.

It will come because the people of Southeast Asia
want it -- those whose armies are at war tonight, and those
who, though threatened, have thus far been spared.

Peace will come because Asians were willing to work
for it -- and to sacrifice for it -- and to die by the
thousands for it.

But let it never be forgotten: peace will come also
because America sent her sons to help secure it.

Tt has not been easy -- far from it. During the past
four and a half years, it has been my fate and my responsi-
bility to be commander-in-chief. I have lived -- daily and
nightly -- with the cost of this war. I know the pain that
it has inflicted. I know perhaps better than anyone the
misgivings that it has aroused.

Throughout this entire, long period, I have been sus-
tained by a single principle:

-- that what we are doing now, in Vietnam, is vital
not only to the security of Southeast Asia, but it is
vital to the security of every American.

Surely we have treaties which we must respect.
Surely we have commitments that we are going to keep.
Resolutions of the Congress testify to the need to resist
aggression in the world and in Southeast Asia.

But the heart of our involvement in South Vietnam --
under three Presidents, three separate Administrations --
has always been America's own security.

And the larger purpose of owr involvement has always
been to help the nations of Southeast Asia become inde-
pendent and stand alone, self-sustaining as members of a
great world community.
