DEPT wishes to have FOL MSG delivered to Bao Dai personally by
MIN IMMED after Chief of State"s arrivel: in Saigon. It SHLD be
delivered informally without submission written text with sufficient
emphasis to leave no doubt in Emperor's mind that it represents
DEPIS studied opinion in matter now receiving ATIN highest auths
US GOVT. Begin MSG:

Beo Dai will arrive in Saigon at moment when Vietnam is facing ~
grave crisis outcome of which may decide whether country will be
permitted develop independence status or pass in near future to one
of Sino-Soviet dominated satellite, a new form of colony immeasurably
worse than the old from which Vietnam has so recently separated
herself.

The US GOVT is at present moment taking steps to increase
the AM? of aid to FR Union and ASSOC States in their effort to
defend the territorial integrity of IC and prevent the incorporation
of the ASSOC States within the COMIE-dominated bloc of slave states
but even the resources of US are strained by our present UN
commitments in Korea, the need for aid in the defense of Western
Surope and our own rearmament program. We sometimes find it im-
possivle to furnish aid as we {j/LD wish in a given AMT at a given
time and. in a given place.
