A senior captain in the Viet Cong intelligence service wrote a
record of his experiences in a document entitled Regroupment Diary;
according to this document, his political officer lectured the unit
as follows: a/

"(1) Have confidence in the leadership of the General Comittee.
In two years, the country will be re-unified, because that
was the decision of an international body, which gives us
reason to trust it. This does not mean that we should be
too trustful, but we must continue to struggle.
