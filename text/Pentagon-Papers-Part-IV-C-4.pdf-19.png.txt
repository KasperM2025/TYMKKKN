General Harold
Johnson's "Report
on Trip to South
Vietnam"

JCSM 204-65

DESCRIPTION

General Johnson, in SVN from 5-12 March,
was as impressed by the gravity of the
situation -- particularly in I Corps --
as were Saigon officials. He submitted
several proposals -- including deploy-
ment of additional U.S. ground troops

-- for attaining U.S. objectives (per-
suade NVN to abandon support and direction
of the insurgency, defeat the insurgents,
create a stable GVN). He said more U.S.
action was necessary because "what the
situation requires may exceed what the
Vietnemese can be expected to do."

To release ARVN for offensive action,
General Johnson proposed sending a U.S.
division either to the Bien Hoa/Tan Son °
Nhut area plus some coastal enclaves or
to Kontum, Pleiku and Darlac Provinces

‘in the highlands. Both General Johnson

and Mr. McNamara preferred the second
alternative -- but McNamara found neither
efficient in terms of ARVN released per
U.S. input and he also favored a ROK
division rather than U.S. troops.

General Johnson recommended the SEATO
Treaty be invoked and a four-division
MLF be deployed across the DMZ "from
the South China Sea to the Mekong River"
to counter infiltration.

Finally he said to evaluate MACV's re-
quests properly e policy decision "must
be made now to determine what the
Vietnamese should be expected to do for
themselves and how much more the U.S.
must contributé directly to the security
of South Vietnam.” Mr. McNamara noted
in the margin: "Policy is: anything that
will strengthen the position of the GVil
will be sent....”

The JCS proposed that U.S. troops be
deployed to South Vietnem for active
operations against the Viet Cong.
