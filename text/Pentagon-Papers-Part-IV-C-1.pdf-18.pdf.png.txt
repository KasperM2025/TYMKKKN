DESCRIPTION

The President sends Secretary McNamara
and General Taylor on another fact-
finding trip to prepare for a major
re-evaluation of the war and US involve-
ment. While there, a set of recommen-
dations to the President is decided
upon.

Prior to their departure, McNamara and
Taylor present their principal con-
elusions to General Khanh who is re-
sponsive to their suggestions and, in
particular, declares his readiness to
move promptly on a national mobiliza-
tion and inereasing ARVN and Civil Guard.

Having resigned over policy disagreement,
Hilsman sends Rusk parting memos on SEA
and SVN. He describes two principles

. basic to success in guerrilla warfare:

(1) the oil blot approach to progres-~
sive rural security; and (2) the avoi-
dance of large-scale operations. He
further opposes redirecting the war effort
against the North. Political stability
is absolutely essential to eventual
victory.

The JCS, in commenting on McNamara's
proposed recommendations to the Presi-
dent, reiterate their views of 2 March
that a program of actions against the
North is required to effectively strike
at the sources of the insurgency. The
overall military recommendations pro-
posed by McNamara are inadequate, they
feel.

Largely ignoring the JCS reclama,
McNamara reports on the conclusions

of his trip to Vietnam and recommends
the full civilian and military mobili-
zation to which General Khanh has
committed himself. This is to be
accompanied by an extensive set of
internal reforms and organizational
improvements. Some increases in US
personnel are recommended along with
increased materiel support for the GVN.
