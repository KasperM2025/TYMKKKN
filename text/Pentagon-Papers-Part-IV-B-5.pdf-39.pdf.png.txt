DESCRIPTION

.. the government. Harkins’

assessment is guardedly opti-
mistic, taking note of the

“higher than average VC activity

in the week after the coup.

The determination of the new
leaders impressed him, but he
was concerned about the dis-
ruptions that wholesale replace-
ments of province and district
chiefs might have.

The press release gives few
details but does reiterate the
U.S. intention to withdraw
1,000 troops, by the end of
the year.

‘Having flown to Washington

the day after the conference,
Lodge meets with the President
and presumably continues the
kind of report given in Honolulu.

Drawing together the results

of the Honolulu Conference. and
Lodge's meeting with the Presi-
dent, NSAM 273 reaffirms;>the
U.S. commitment to defeat the

VC in South Vietnam. It reiter-
ates the plan to withdraw 1,000
troops by year's end and to end
the war in the first three corps
areas by the end of 1964 and

in the Delta by the end-of 1965.
U.S. support for the new regime
is confirmed and aid in at least
the amounts given to Diem is
guaranteed. The Delta is to

be the srea of concentration
for ell military, poJAitical,
economic and social efforts.

And clandestine operations .
against the North and into

laos are authorized. a
