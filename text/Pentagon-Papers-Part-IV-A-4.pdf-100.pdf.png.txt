Large excesses of equipment in Vietnam resulted from the decrease

in numbers of both the FEC and the VNA; the VNA were totally incapable of

assuming logistical responsibility, and the withdrawal of the FEC resulted
in the dumping of mountains of equipment on the Vietnamese; further, the
French were confronted with a deteriorating situation in North Africa and
were concerned with salvaging the best equipment for their own use and
refused to allow U.S. personnel into their installations and supply dumps
to inventory both the qualitative and quantitative status of inventory.

rE RM per se was disbanded and its personnel assigned to MAAG in
1960. By some TERM was labelled a "subterfuge" from the military point
of view (see "Study on Army Aspects..." pp. D-IFF); that it was probably
also a useful subterfuge+from an intelligence point of view is revealed
by Allen W. Dulles' strong endorsement of SECDEF's desire to augment MAAG
Vietnam, which concludes his statement regarding the need for additional
CIA slots under military cover in Vietnam. Memorandum for SECSTATE from
