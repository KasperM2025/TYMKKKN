Dulles outlines U.S. policy on Indochina to Bidault. The

U.S.: (1) is fully aware of the importance of the French ;
struggle; (2) sees the situation with "real sense of "
urgency";(3) shares concern regarding "adequacy of the

financial contribution" by Indochinese ana French residents

there; (4) desires agreement that Viet Minh defeat would

deter CHICOM intervention; and (5) appreciates French views

. on participation by Associated States in discussing policy

and receiving U.S. military and economic aid. Dulles 4907

President Eisenhower stresses the importance of EDC as a

means for European viability to Mayer and LeTourneau. The
"President declared that EDC is so important in American

eyes that the American people would not support aid to

France if they were given the impression that France is

resorting to dilatory tactics in order to postpone ratifi-
cation...." Dulles 4992 to Paris, 26 March 1953...e.ccccese. 7

Secretary Dulles reassures the French that a "Chinese

Communist attack is unlikely" in Indochina and that an

Korean armistice would have "automatically failed /its

purpose.” Dulles 5001 to Paris, 27 March 1953.....s-ceceeeeee 19

The French plan to create "strong free states, in Indochina"

is to be studied even though Eisenhower feels that the time-

table is too slow. The U, S. is intent on doing nothing

to increase France's difficulties. Dulles 5040 to Paris,

Cost deficits of the French "strategic concept” are $231

million and $299.3 million for CY 1954 and 1955. No formal
request for the U.S. to assume the deficits is made but

"French intent is clear that is their plan." Dulles 1967

President Eisenhower indicates publicly that an armistice

in Korea should mean "an end to the direct and indirect

attacks upon the security of Indochina and Malaya." The

warning is clear to Red China that armies released by the
armistice to attack elsewhere would make the armistice

"a fraud." White House Press Release, 16 April 1953.......... 23

The JCS summarize the weaknesses of the French Plan pre-

sented by LeTourneau and Allard. Briefly, the plan is not
aggressive, insufficient consideration is given to cutting

the enemy supply lines, insufficient emphasis is given to

placing responsibility on the Vietnamese, and the plan

relies extensively on small unit cperations. See also
