U.S. Army-type training programs; throughout, it is clear that the
MAAG looked increasingly to the Self Defense Corps, the Civil Guard,
and the National Police to meet the "Viet Minh" internal threat in
order to free ARVN for conventional combat training. See especially
U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, Vietnam, “Country Statement -
on MDAP, non-NATO Countries," paragraphs 1, 5, 6, and Section C, of

Highway had been undertaken for military reasons, and that "this
20-mile stretch of highway cost more money than the United States
provided for all labor, community development, social welfare,
housing, health, and education projects in Vietnam combined during
the entire period 1954-1961."

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, Memorandum for the President,
17 November 1954, subject: "General Collins' Recommendations
Regarding Military Force Levels in Vietnam.”

JCS, Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, 22 September 1954, sub-
ject: "Retention and Development of Forces in Indochina," sets an
objective of a minimum French force of four divisions until four RVNAF
divisions were available to replace them; it also stresses that the
Geneva Agreement constituted in Vietnam "a major obstacle to the
introduction of adequate U.S. MAAG personnel and of additional arms
and equipment." In a JCS Memo of 19 October 1954, subject: "Develop-
ment and Training of Indigenous Forces in Indochina," the Chiefs,
noting the Geneva limit on personnel, recommended against MAAG's RVNAF
unless "political considerations are overriding." In a Memo of

17 November 1954, subject: "Indochina," the JCS addressed the prob-
lem of a 77,000 man RVNAF, and found it adequate for internal security
only; noting the Viet Minh strength, they stated that a force of that
size could not provide for external security if French forces were with-
drawn, but agreed that the MAAG could train RVNAF at that level while
complying with Geneva ceilings on personnel. Other examples of the
continuing U.S. concern for observing the Geneva Agreements on the one
hand, and on the other hand proceeding with the task of providing for
Vietnam's security within its restrictions are provided in the MAAG,
Country Statements, op. cit., and in U.S. Dept of State telegram 2601
from Paris, of 19 December 1954, in which Secretary Dulles accepted
