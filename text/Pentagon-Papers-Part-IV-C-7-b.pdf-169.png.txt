VOLUNTEERS IF NORTH VIETNAM WOULD ACCEPT THEM, ALTHOUGH MOST LIKELY
TN ANTIATRCRAFT AND OTHER DEFENSIVE ROLES. IN SOME CASES THEY
MIGHT ASK FOR USE CHINESE ATRFIELDS, I SHOULD THINK SUPPLY OF
MEDIUM RANGE ROCKETS OR OTHER SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT A REAL

POSSIBILITY.
kh, FOLLOWING ARE COMMENTS ON SPECIFIC CASES ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT

MY CRYSTAL BALL IS VERY CLOUDY:

A. MINING OF HATPHONG HARBOR WOULD CERTAINLY PROVOKE STRONG SOVIET
REACTION. AS A MIMUM IT WOULD EXPECT THEM TO PROVIDE MINHSWEEPERS ,
POSSIBLY WITH SOVIET NAVAL CREWS. BECAUSE OF INCREASED DEPENDENCE
OF NVN ON CHINA FOR SUPPLIES AS A RESULT SUCH ACTION, SOVIETS WOULD
READ INTO THIS WIDER IMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE SINO-SOVIET QUARREL.
B. INTENSIFIZD BOMBING OF HANOL HATPHONG AREA MIGHT CAUSE SOVIETS
TO ARM THEIR MERCHANT SHIPS OR POSSIBLY EVEN ESCORT THEM IF ONE

WERE SUNK. IF HEAVY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES RESULTED THEY MIGHT PERSUADE
WVN TO AGREE TO BRING MATTER TO THE UN AND WOULD AT LEAST ORGANIZE
WORLDWIDE PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AND POSSIBLY PUSH FOR INTERNATIONAL

BOyYcort.

CG. AN INCHON-TYPE LANDING WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE EXTREMELY GRAVE
REACTION. NATURE SOVIET ACTION WOULD BE AFFECTED BY WHAT CHINESE
COMMUNISTS DID. SOVIETS WOULD NOT WISH TO BE IN POSITION OF

DOING LESS. THEY WOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER LANDING AS PRELUDE TO
FULL SCALE INVASION AND DESTRUCTION NVN GOVERNMENT REGARDLESS OF
HOW WE DESCRIBED THE OPERATION.

D. I DOUBT THAT OUR ACTIVITY IN NORTHERN PORTION OF DMZ WOULD BE
REGARDED AS VERY SERIOUS BUT RAIDS BEYOND THAT WOULD CAUSE STRONGER
REACTION DEPENDING SOMEWHAT UPON HOW IT WAS REPORTED IN WORLD PRESS.
THEY WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT WE MIGHT BE LAUNCHING TRIAL BALLOON
AND THAT THETR FAILURE TO REACT STRONGLY MIGHT INVITE ACTUAL INVASION.
E. I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THEY WOULD TAKE US/GVN GROUND ACTION
IN LAOS LESS SERIOUSLY THAN SIMILAR ACTION IN CAMBODIA, PARTICULARLY
TF THIS FOLLOWED FURTHER SUCCESSFUL PATEREY LAO VNV OFFENSIVES.

PF, I THINK THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE SOVIET REACTION TO INCREASED
J.ยง. DEPLOYMENTS IN SVN ALTHOUGH THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME
TNOREASE IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED BY
SOVIETS. THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE OF REQUEST FOR MASSIVE BUDGET

INCREASE.
