COMUSMACV 02916 (Westmoreland Sends) to Deputy Commanding General,
USARV, "Command Guidance (U)," dated 2h January 1967.

Ibid.

Ibid. The public relations aspect was real. less than a month
later, R. W. Apple, of the New York Times, was to write a major
piece, cutting away the facade of "good" PR which had covered
RVNAF performance to discuss the lack of effectiveness of such
units as he found them.

COMUSMACV 00610 to CINCPAC for Admiral Sharp and General Wheeler
from General Westmoreland, Subj: "Year-End Assessment of Enemy
Situation and Enemy Strategy (U)," dated 2 January 1967.

Ibid. These figures roughly conform to corrected OB and strength
estimates developed later in the year, when MACV reported 116,552
combat, 41,700 administrative service and 126,200 guerrilla troops
for a total of 283,900 compared to 280,575 in this cable. See:
MACV Monthly Order of Battle Summary, 31 October 1967.

Ibid.

Ibid. This infiltration figure of 84.00 per month is slightly below
the figure of 9100 contained in the MACV Command History 1966. At
the end of 1966, MACV accepted a figure of 48,400 infiltrators during
the year, plus an additional 25,600 "may have infiltrated into South >
Vietnam on the basis of information evaluated as possibly true."

This total of 74,000 "possible" and "accepted" provided the base for
MACV calculations at the time. See: USMACV Command History 1966,
"Infiltration Into RVN," p. 22. A 7 November 1967 OSD STAT Summary
gave an "accepted" figure of 55,300 infiltrators, or if you add the
MACV "possible" figure about 9000 per month. See: "Southeast Asia
Analysis Report," OASD(SA)SEA Programs Directorate, No. 8-0054
(Special Supplement). â€˜The recruitment figure conforms to a more
sophisticated estimate on VC recruitment, one which concluded that
the MACV estimate of 7000 VC recruited per month in 1966 was probably
not valid for 1967. The key finding of the study was that the VC
probable rate was near 3500 men per month. See: CICV Study st 67-081,
"VC In-Country Recruitment" dated 15 September 1967, and Ibid., SHA
Analysis Report.
