If the forces outlined under the optimum force request were granted
priority was to be accorded to the expansion of secure areas. The RVNAF
would be given the primary responsibility of providing military support
of Revolutionary Development activities and Revolutionary Development
operations would be intensified throughout the country as the pacified
areas were expanded. MACV explained that such increased demands on the
RVNAF would establish a concomitant demand for additional U.S. force
resources to fill the operational void resulting from the intensified
Revolutionary Development orientation of the RVNAF. â€˜The long message
also broke out the minimum essential and optimum package forces by service
and by total troops as shown in the table below. 30/

The total optimum force end strength was 678,248 arrived at by adding the
approved Program 4 strength of 470,000 to the earlier MACV reclama of

8,821 (see page 68 this section) and the "optimum force" additive of
199,017. The justification for additional forces broken out by corps
tactical zones were essentially the same as those presented in the original
MACV request on 18 March. However, the later document prepared at PACOM
Has on the 28th reflected the increased concern with the enemy threat
developing in the I Corps tactical zone. Concerning this threat, COMUSMACYV
wrote:

"In I Corps tactical zone, the bulk of the population
and the food producing regions are within 15 miles of the
coast. In the northern part of the zone, multiple NVA
Divisions possess the capability to move south of the DMZ.
Additionally, there is constant enemy activity in much of
the coastal area. The topography of I Corps lends itself
to the establishment and maintenance of enemy base areas in
the remote, sparsely populated regions. The enemy has opera-
tea for years virtually unmolested throughout most of Quang
Ngai Province because friendly forces could not be diverted
from other important tasks.

"There are several important tasks which must be per-
formed in I Corps. Security of bases and key population
