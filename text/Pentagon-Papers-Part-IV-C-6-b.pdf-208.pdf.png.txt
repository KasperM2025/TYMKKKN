The total basic units strength under this 3-2/3 division equivalent
was 51,249 troops, with a total force strength of 86,213. Although the
documents which are available are unclear on this point, it appears that
Secretary McNamara was prepared to authorize eventual deployment of all
of the 3-2/3 division equivalent force. Although, again, the documenta-
tion is incomplete it appears that he had been given the green light by
the President to negotiate anywhere below this level but not to exceed
it, that is, not to bump up against the crucial mobilization line.

Within the staffs preparing the briefings and the background papers
for the SecDef as he departed for Saigon there was a generally held
belief that this was the scenario which the Saigon visit would follow:
The Secretary would explore in detail the justifications for General
Westmoreland's minimum essential force after which he and the General
would bargain and negotiate the civilianization differences which could
be worked out. This "compromise" would be the ultimate force package --
Program V. There was little or any doubt among those working on the
exact force levels and composition of the different packages, that the
86,000 total which had been developed in the Systems Analysis memoran-
dum would not be exceeded and probably that the final force program
package added would approximate closer to 50-65,000. 52/
