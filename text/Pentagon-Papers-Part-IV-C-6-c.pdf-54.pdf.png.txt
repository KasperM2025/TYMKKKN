CONCLUSIONS
(To Defeat the VC/NVA in SVN)

This Option would:

a. Assuming no additional deployments
break enemy offensive and permit
early and sustained operations
against the enemy.

b. Permit simultaneous operations
against enemy main force, base
areas, and border sanctuaries.

c. Permit resumption of program to
develop effectiveness of RVNAF.

d. Permit greater employment of air as-
sets in conducting an expanded air
campaign against NVN, Laos, Cambodia.

Essentially the same as Option I except:

a. The rate of conducting operations
would be reduced by higher military risk.

b. The enemy would enjoy sanctuary
across the Cambodian/Laotian/NVN borders.

c. The rebuilding of the RVNAF would be
at a slower pace.

US objectives in SVN cannot be achieved
as allied forces must remain in defensive
posture.

At present levels, allied forces can
expect increasingly grave threats to
their security with high casualty rates.

This option could probably secure the
cities but would be insufficient to
counter the current enemy offensive or
to restore security in the countryside.

The results of this Option are essentially

the same as Option I, except:

a. The rate of progress would be slower.

b. The enemy would retain the initiative
in the border areas.
