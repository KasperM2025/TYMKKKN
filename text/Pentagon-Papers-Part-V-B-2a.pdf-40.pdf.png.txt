5. While avoiding specific commitments with regard to the amount
or character of any assistance which the United States may give to the
French resistance forces in Indo-China, this Government should continue
to afford all possible assistance provided it does not interfere with
the requirements of other planned operations.

6. In addition to the aid which we are able to bring from the
China theater of operations to the French forces resisting the Japanese
in Indo-China, the United States should oppose no obstacle to the
implementation of proposals looking toward the despatch of assistance
to those forces from the southeast Asia theater of operations, provided
such assistance does not constitute a diversion of resources which the
Combined Chiefs of Staff consider are needed elsewhere.
