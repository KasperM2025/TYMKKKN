 Cranrr-
l. . Our discussions with the French and Associated States military
3 authorities were on all occasions conducted in an atmosphere of frankness
and military comradeship. I myself was particularly frank in my discus-

sions with General Navarre, and his deputy, General Bodet,-as well as

the (oman ne Generals of North, Central ana South Vietnam and the
French Naval and Air Commander, in which discussions I stressed the need
for: (a) wrostine te military initiative from the enemy now, (b) im-
mediately initiating the reorganizabion of French and Associated States
heuihe on a divisional basis, (c) reorganizing and improving the training
of the Armies of the kenoetaved States, (d) hastening the turnover of
leadership and staff fassonsibilicies, particularly on the divisional
and regimental levels, to officers of the isobiated Glaves, and

(e) improving the utilization of air and navy potential in Indochina.
Prior to his departure from Paris (2 Jul 53), General Navarre presented.
me with a written plan of action, henceforth referred to as the "Navarre
Plan" (see Annex NE"), and expressed himself orally along lines which

| assured me thzut he intends to take conclusive action toward achieving
"his goal. | | .

. china: | ME feel confident that the anti-Communist military forces now in
Indochina, with soupstenticne ceeecture reorgenization into regiments
and divisions, are capable of achieving military victory against the
Ponces curently arrayed against them. (See Annex "F" for discussion
of opposing military forces) Hovever, this would require a complete
change in French military psychology associated with Indoch ina and

would entail some risk, both military and political, in the redisposi-

tion of forces, which the French are unwilling to take.
