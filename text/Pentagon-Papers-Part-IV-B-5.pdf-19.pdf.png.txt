DESCRIPITON

General Don, armed forces commander
under the martial law decree, has
contacted a CAS officer and asked why
the U.S. was broadcasting the erroneous
story that the Army had conducted the
pagoda raids. WNhu's special forces
were responsible. The U.S, should make.
its position known. A separate con-
tact by another general with a member
of the mission had brought another
inquiry as to the U.S. position.

The query is clear. Would we support
the Army if it acted against Nhu and/or
Diem?

large student protest demonstrations

on behalf of the imprisoned Buddhists ©
take place at the faculties of medicine
and pharmacy at the University of
Saigon. They are a dramatic break with
the tradition of student apathy to
politics in Vietnam. The regime re-
acts with massive arrests.

Lodge lays the blame for the raids at
Nhu's feet and states thet his influ-
ence is significantly increased. But,
in view of the loyalty of Saigon area
commanders, a coup attempt would be

a "shot in the dark."

Subsequently known as the "Aug 2h
cable," this controversial message ac-
knowledges Nhu's responsibility for
the raids and says that U.S. can no
longer tolerate his continuation in
power. If Diem is unable or unwilling
to remove him, the generals are to

be told that the U.S. will be prepared
to discontinue economic and military
support, accept the obvious implica-
tion and will promise assistance to
them in any period of interim break-
down of the GVN. Lodge's permission
is requested for a VOA broadcast
exonerating the Army of responsibility
for the Aug 21. raids.
