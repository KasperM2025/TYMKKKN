MEMORANDUM FOR THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

SUBJECT: Broadening the Participation of the United States
in the Indochina Operation

In the memorandum of 14 November 1952 to the Secretary of
Defense, concerning the Report of the Five Power Conference on
Southeast Asia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised that, from a
military viewpoint, it was desirable to aid the French to speed
development of indigenous combat forces and to improve the
supporting logistical and operating facilities.

Since an effective French-supported offensive in Indochina
has failed to materialize and a continued stalemate is indicated,
the Joint Secretaries have been requested, by memorandum, to con-
sider United States support of a material augmentation of Vietnam
Forces in Indochina. A copy of this memorandum is attached.

it is requested that the Joint Chiefs of Staff also undertake
a reexamination of United States participation in the Indochina
operation, giving special consideration to training of indigenous
forces and maintenance of United States supplied equipment by
United States personnel.
