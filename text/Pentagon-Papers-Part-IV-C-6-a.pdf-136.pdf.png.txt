This approach appears to have some distinct disadvantages. First,
we are finding very Shr Onety diminishing marginal returns in the destruc-
tion of VG/iVA forces. If our estimates of enemy losses (killed, captured
and defected) are pore, VC/NVA losses increased by only 115 per week -
(less than 15%) during a period in which we increased friendly strength
by 160,000 including 1h0, 000 U.S. military personnel and 42 U.S. and Third
Country maneuver battalions. At this rate, an additional 100,000 friendly
personnel deployed would increase VC/NVA losses by some 70 per week. Se-
cond, expanding U.S. deployments have contributed to a very serious in-
flation in South Vietnam. Prices increased 75-90% in FY66. An extra 100,000
U.S. forces would add at least PJ billion to our piaster expenditures, doubl-
ing the 1967 inflationary gap in SVN. Third, the high and increasing cost
of the war to the United States is likely to encourage the Communists to
doubt our staying power and to try to “wait us out."

The-secon approach is to follow a_ similarly aggressive strates; gy of of

"seek out and a but to build friendly forces s only to that level re-
guired to neutralize the large enemy units and prevent them from int a interfering

_with the pacification program. Tt is essential to this approach that such
a level be consistent with a stable economy in SVN, and consistent with a

military posture that the United States credibly would meintein indefinitely,
thus making 2 Comminist attemt to "wait us out” less attractive.

J believe that this level is about 470,000 U.S. and 52,000 Free World
personnel and less than half of the ARVN.* The remainder of the ARVN, plus
@ portion of the U.S. force, would give priority to improving the pacifi-
cation effort. The enemy regular units would cease to perform what I believe
to be their primary function of diverting our effort to give security to the
population. This, plus the effects of a ‘successful interdiction campaign
to cut off their other support, would effectively neutralize them, possibly
at the cost of far fewer casualties to both sides than the first approach
would allow.
