Galbraith at least, and probably others, advised Kennedy that there was
not much point to bargaining with Diem anyway, since he would never

serious effort to make the aid program really contingent on reforms by
Diem. Since the war soon thereafter began to look better, Kennedy never
had occasion to reconsider his decision on combat troops; and no urgent
reason to consider Galbraith's advice on getting rid of Diem until late

1963.
