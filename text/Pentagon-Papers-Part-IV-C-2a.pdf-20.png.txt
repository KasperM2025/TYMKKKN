DESCRIPIION
President felt such action "...
might have only limited military
effect and could trigger wider
Communist action in Leos."

Reported GVN-RLG agreement on po-
litical and military issues. Dip-
lomatic relations had been reestab-
lished. Laos granted free passage
into southern Laos to GVN forces,
the right to bomb infiltration
areas with unmarked T-28s and to
conduct hot pursuit, commando raids
and sabotage operations "without
limit" into Laotian territory to
combined RLG-GVN units. A combined
Laotian-Vietnamese staff was to be
created.

The JCS directed CINCPAC to begin
"Planning Actions, Vietnam” in

line with Recommendations 11 and

12 of NSAM 288. The program was
to"permit sequential implementation"
of three actions (border controls,
retaliatory cross-border operations
with 72-hour responsiveness, gradu-~
ated overt military pressures
against NVN with 30-days responsive-
ness).

Confirmed that actions with North
Vietnam as the target mentioned
in NSAM 288 were regarded strictly
as contingency planning and that
interagency study was so oriented.

State/ISA planners presented three
papers. The first was a scenario —
for current actions (political
steps to increase Congressional
and international understanding of
U.S, aims plus continued military
action by GVN with U.S, advisory
assistance). The second scenario
called for overt GVN/covert U.S.
action against NVN (characterized
by the GVN-USAF FARMGATE operation) ;
it emphasized political initiatives
