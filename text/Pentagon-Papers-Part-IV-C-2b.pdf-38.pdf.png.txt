addition to repeating points made earlier, Seaborn's second message
conveyed the U.S. Government's uncertainty over DRV intentions in

the 4 August attack and explained that subsequent U.S. deployments of
additional airpower to South Vietnam and Thailand were "precautionary."

In addition, the new message stressed: (1) shat the Tonkin Gulf events
demonstrated that "U.S. public and official patience‚Äù was wearing thin; (2)
that the Congressional Resolution reaffirmed U.S. determination "to con-
tinue to oppose firmly, by all necessary means, DRV efforts to subvert

and conquer South Vietnam and Iaos"; and (3) that "if the DRV persists

in its present course, it can expect to suffer the consequences." 45/

Thus, in the immediate aftermath of the provocation handed: the U.S.
Government in the Tonkin Gulf, the Administration was able to carry out
most of the actions recommended by its principal officials early in the _
Summer. By the same token, it was reducing the number of unused measures
short of direct military action that had been conceived as available for
exerting effective pressure on the DRV. In effect, as it made its com-
mitments in Southeast Asia clearer it also deepened them, and in the
process it denied itself access to some of the uncommitting options which
it had perceived earlier as offering policy flexibility. 46/ Meanwhile,
other events were also having the effect of denying options which had
been considered useful alternatives to strikes against the North.
