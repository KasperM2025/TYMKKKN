De Lattre referred to the prospect of peace in
Korea and his hope that, if successful, it would

Korea to Indochina. The Secretary answered that he

expressed his theory that the Korean and Indochina
wars were "one war" and that in order to be effective
there must be "one peace"

Finally, Mr. Schuman spoke of the excellent im-
pression the Associated States delegations had made
at San Francisco. The Secretary agreed with this
observation.

The interview closed with the General's comment
that "we must save these countries from the fate of
communism"; the Secretary reaffirmed this conviction
and the Department's intention to cooperate fully with
the General in the course of his presentation to the
United States authorities.
