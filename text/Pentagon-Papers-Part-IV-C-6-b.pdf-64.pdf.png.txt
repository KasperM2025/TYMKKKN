CINCPAC 1822107 January 1967. Destruction and interdiction missions
in the Laotian Panhandle had not been as productive in November and
December 1966 as everyone had hoped, and as military calculations
increasingly turned on infiltration figures, efforts were made in
mid-January to seek improved measures. On 15 January 1967, General
Westmoreland, LIG Momyer and their staffs met with Ambassadors
Martin and Sullivan at Udorn. /See: COMUSMACV 01819 (Section I

and II) for Admiral Sharp, info to General Wheeler from General
Westmoreland, Subj: "Udorn Conference," dated 16 January 1967./
Little came of the conference except renewed efforts to cut reaction
times and improve coordination.  COMUSMACV's efforts to amend rules of
engagement met State resistance, a harbinger of the resistance that
was to meet future efforts to expand operations in Laos and Cambodia.
