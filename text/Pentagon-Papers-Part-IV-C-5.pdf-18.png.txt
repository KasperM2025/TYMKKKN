17 Mar MACV 1707472 Westmoreland recommended
landing one Marine BLT
at Phu Bai, near Hue, to
secure airfield there and
enable thereby movement of
helicopters from congested
area at Da Nang to Phu Bai.
Recommended a 4th BLT within
@ month.

18 Mar Embtel 3003 Taylor supported Westmoreland's
Phu Bai request above and went
on to discuss pro's and con's
of introduction of U.S. Divi-
sion without offering a recom-

mendation.
19 Mar CINC PAC Sharp recommended to JCS
1922072 that remainder of MEB be

landed within a month and
one BLT at Phu Bai be
landed ASAP.

20 Mar JCSM 204-65 JCS proposed sending 2 US
and 1 ROK division to SVN

for active operations against
vc. Marines to I CTZ could
be had quickly in concert
with US/SEATO contingency
plens for DRV/Chicom
aggression. (A portion of
this proposal could have
been construed as a deter-
rent measure to Chicom
aggression.) All forces
were to engage in offensive
operations with or without
eentralized command structure.
Location for ROK Div not speci-
fied, but Army Div was to go
to II CTZ highlands to release
ARVN battalions for operations
along the coast. The JCS pro-
posed resupplying it by air
until Rte 19 could be opened.
This r√©commendation considered
by the JCS to be an essential
component of the broader pro-
gram to put pressure on the
DRV/VC
