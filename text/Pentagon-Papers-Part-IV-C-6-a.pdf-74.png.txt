difference in the December 66 strengths of the 10 April Plan (later
retroactively designated Program No. 2) was 7,500 while the difference
in the June 1967 strengths was 5,900 -- hardly very large changes.

An explanation may lie in an exchange of memoranda which took place
between 28 June and 15 July. On 28 June, the President wrote Secretary
McNamara as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

As you know, we have been moving our men to Viet Nam on a
schedule determined by General Westmoreland's requirements.

As I have stated orally several times this year, I should
like this schedule to be accelerated as much as possible so that
General Westmoreland can feel assured that he has all the men he
needs as soon as possible.

that “it appears that no significant acceleration of supportable combat-
ready forces beyond those indicated will be attained." McNamara then
replied to the President on 15 July that the Department of Defense had
been "making strenuous efforts to accelerate deployments." 8/ He added,

I am happy to report that this effort has been successful,
and we will be able to provide more troops and equipment during
the remainder of this calendar year than we had though possible
last spring...To illustrate the degree of acceleration already
achieved, we now plan to have 79 Army and Marine Corps maneuver
battalions in South Vietnam by December 1966, as compared to the-
7O battalions we thought could be safely deployed only four months
ago. We now expect to have 395,000 personnel in South Vietnam

’ by the end of this year compared to 314,000 estimated last March.

The whole exchange may have a purpose other than simply requesting.
