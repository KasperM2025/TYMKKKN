Disadvantages:

1.

Introduction of these forces could lead to
counter-moves by Hanoi, with result we have
simply expanded the present war. (Need paper
with better analysis of whether Hanoi could
add troops.) Our position is one of meeting
infiltration, not stimulating it. Even its
proponents do not argue it could end the war
in less than two years.

It might well be viewed by Hanoi as another
sign of US impatience and unwillingness to
persist. Hanoi might also see a call-up of
reserves as a sign that we are running out
of manpower.

Congressional and public debate on the
reserve call-up would be divisive and give
comfort to Hanoi.

It could mean a total eventual addition of
500,000 men; some limitation on our ability
to act elsewhere in the world; and a cost
of approximately $10 billion in Fy '68.

â€œIt could lead to irresistible pressures for

ground actions against sanctuaries in Cambodia
and Laos, and increased actions against NVN.
Problems involved in such moves -- NVN and even
Chinese reactions. International disapproval.
Problems with Souvanna.

Effect on US flexibility and, inevitably, US
goals in Viet-Nam.

It could produce, to some extent, a growth
in the South Vietnamese attitude of "let the
US do it."

More troops probably mean growth of anti-
Americanism. (Although we don't really know
how strong it is now.)

Inflationary effects in South Viet-Nam.
