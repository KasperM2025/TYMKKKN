DESCRIPTION

thought and preparation. At the 19
April meeting with the Country Team,
much of the discussion is devoted to
the problem of pressures against the
North.

General William Westmoreland is named
to succeed General Harkins in the
summer.

The JCS, worried at the GVN delay,
ask MACY to submit the force plan for

1964 by 7 May.

In a showdown with Khanh, Lodge, Brent
and Westmoreland state that the funda-
mental problem is lack of administra-
tive support for the provincial war
against the VC, particularly the inade-
quacy of the piastre support for the
pacification program. Khanh promises
more effort.

lodge informs the President that Khanh
has agreed to US advisors in the paci-
fied areas if we are willing to accept
easualties. Lodge recommends one
advisor for each corps area and one
for Khanh, all reporting to Lodge.

Lodge reports that the draft mobiliza-
tion decrees have still not been
signed or promulgated.

Having asked to see Lodge, Khanh asks
him whether he, Lodge, thinks the
country should be put on a war footing.
Khanh wants to carry the war to the
North and sees this as necessary pre-
liminary.

The NSC confirms Rusk's caution to
Khanh on any moves against the North.
The President asks McNamara to make
a fact~finder to Vietnan.
