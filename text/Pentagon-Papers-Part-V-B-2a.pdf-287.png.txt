“se set-back because of the economic vacuum resulting from the defeat
of Japan, the devastation caused by the war in other areas and the
interference and restrictions arising from extensive governmental
controls. Given a favorable and secure atmosphere--plus adequate
freedom to individual traders, pesdliy avaliable working capital,
suitable commercial agreements establishing conditions favorable to
commerce and navigation and general assistance in the promotion of
trade--it is expected that a substantial increase in intra-Asia trade
can occur. The patterns of such trade, however, may differ from
those existing before the war. In any event, a strong trading area
among the free countries of Asia would add to general economic devel-
opment and strengthen social and political stability. Some kind of

“(py regional assocetion, facilitating interchange of information, among
the non-Communist countries of Asia might become an important means
of developing a. favorable atmosphere for such trade among themselves
and with other parts of the world.,

uy, <Asia, particularly South and Southeast Asia, are among the
principal sources of United States imports of several basic commodi-
ties which covld contribute greatly to United States security for
stockpiling purposes and would be of great assistance in time of war
if they remained available to us. Exports to Asia from the United
States are of less importance than are imports, but are not now in-
significant and could.grow in importance to the stability of our own
Gomestic economy. in brief, the economic advantage derived by the
United States from our trade with non-Communist Asia is considerable
_ and there is little doubt of the wisdom of its development.
