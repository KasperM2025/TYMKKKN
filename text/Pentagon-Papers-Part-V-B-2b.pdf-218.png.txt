THE SEATTLE WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL, SEATTLE,

Ors « . ° e . . e

In Indo-China, the United States has taken a
friendly interest in the efforts made to resolve points
of difference between France and the Associated States
and has vigorously supported the determination of France
and of the Associated States to restore security and’
order in the country. Many Americans have been troubled
in the past about the issue of colonialism in Indo-China.
We believe that that question is well on the way to
Solution, that the peoples of the Associated States are
free to assume the extensive responsibility for their ow
affairs that has been accorded them by treaties with
France, . It is not surprising that doubts remain on this
point in Indo-China, among other countries of Asia, and
among some heritage of bitterness and suspicion, those who
have recently passed through a colonial experience are
sensitive and distrustful of western influence, and the
slowness with which the Associated States have been able
to assume the responsibility which is awaiting them has
not demostrated the extent to which the issue of coloni-
&lism has been resolved. The real issue in Indo-China
is whether the peoples of that land will be permitted to
work out their future as they see fit or whether they will
be subjected to a Communist reign of terror and be absorbud
by force into the new colonialism of a Soviet Communist
empire. In this situation, it is generally agreed in
the United States that we should support and assist the
armies of France and of the Associated States in meeting
the armed threat in Indo-China and should furnish economic
and technical assistance to the Associated States as
they shoulder the heavy burdens of independence.
