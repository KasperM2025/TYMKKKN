3. Nationalism During the Franco-Viet Minh War

Both the DRV constitution and the government of November, 1946,
were soon submerged as the Viet Minh geared for war with France. A series
of armed incidents in November, followed by large scale fighting in Hanoi
in late December, destroyed what was left of the Franco-Viet modus vivendi.
The DRV goverrment took to the hills to assume a status of shadow state.
The Viet Minh -- properly, the Lien Viet -- transformed itself into a semi-
covert resistance organization, and committed itself to the military de-
feat of the French. During the opening year of the war, 1947, the DRV
took steps to enhance its coalition nature, and to broaden the appeal
of the Viet Minh. Communists, including Vo Neuyen Giap, were removed
from the cabinet, and prominent Catholics and independents added. There-
after, the government shifted steadily leftward. In the summer of 198,
Giap was reappointed Minister of National Defense, and a year later, Pham
Van Dong, top communist, became Vice President. Moreover, while at first
resistance against the French was offered by disparate political groups,
eventually the Viet Minh, by superior organization and leadership, recap-
tured their monopoly over revolutionary nationalism.

Following is a survey of the principal Vietnamese political movements
in the period 1947-1950. Two main groupings existed: the communist-centered
Viet Minh and its auxiliaries in resistance to the French, and those national-
ists finding common cause in the restoration of Bao Dai.
