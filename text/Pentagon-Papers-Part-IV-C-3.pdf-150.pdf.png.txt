of MAYFLOWER were William Sullivan in Vientiane, Foy Kohler in Moscow,
and Winthrop Brown in Seoul -- the latter only for the purpose of inform-
ing President Park Chung Hee who was about to embark on a state visit to
Washington and who, the Department felt, should be. forewarned so that he
might more effectively fend off press probings-

On the evening of May 11, Secretary Rusk made two moves designed to
inform "the other side‚Äù of the fact that a bombing halt was being called
and of its political purpose:

1. He sent a cable 128/ to Foy Kohler in Moscow, instructing him
to make urgent contact with the DRV Ambassador in Moscow to convey 2
carefully prepared message to him, as quoted below. The cable set forth
the instructions end rationale as follows:

...We are using you as channel to avoid using Soviets as
intermediaries and also to insure that message is accurately

that the underlying cause of trouble in Southeast Asia is armed
action against the people and Government of South Vietnam by
forces whose actions can be decisively affected from North
Vietnam. The United States will be very watchful to see whether
in this period of pause there are significant reductions in such
armed actions by such forces. (The United States must emphasize
that, the rodd toward the end of armed attacks against the people
and Government of Vietnem. is the only road which will permit the
Government of Vietnem(and the Governments of tne Unite ates
to bring a permanent end to their attacks on North Vietnam.)...

In teking this action the United States is well aware of
the risk that a temporary suspension of these air attacks mey
