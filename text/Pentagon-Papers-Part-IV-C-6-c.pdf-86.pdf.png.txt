10. I Shall Not Seek, and I Will. Not Accept...

The President's speech to the nation on 31 March began with a
summary of his efforts to achieve peace in Vietnam over the years. 99/

Good evening, my fellow Americans.

Tonight I want to speak to you of peace in Vietnam and
Southeast Asia.

No other question so preoccupies our people. No other
dream so absorbs the 250 million human beings who live in that
part of the world. No other goal motivates American policy in
Southeast Asia.

For years, representatives of our government and others
have travelled the world -- seeking to find a basis for peace
talks. , ;

Since last September, they have carried the offer that I
wade public at San Antonio.

That offer was this:

That the United States would stop its bombardment of North
Vietnam when that would lead promptly to productive discussions --
and that we would assume that North Vietnam would not take
military advantage of our restraint.

Hanoi denounced this offer, both privately and publicly.
Even while the search for peace was going on, North Vietnam rush-
ed their preparations for a savage assault on the people, the
government, and the allies of South Vietnam.

This attack during the TET holidays, the President indicated, failed

to achieve its principal objectives:

It did not collapse the elected government of South Vietnam
or shatter its army -- as the Communists had hoped.

Tt did not produce a ‘general uprising’ among the people
of the cities as they had predicted.

The Communists were unable to maintain control of any of
the more than 30 cities that they attacked. And they took very
heavy casualties.
