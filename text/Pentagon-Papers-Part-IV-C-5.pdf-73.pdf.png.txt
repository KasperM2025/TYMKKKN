SE: Security was the Primary Mission for Most of the Phase I Units

The security of U.S. bases in mainland Southeast Asia may well
have been dead as a basis for a strategy, but the bases nonetheless

along with other reasons, to justify the further deployment of ground
combat units. In fact, looking back on the force deployments which
were the main subject of this paper, the JCS in November 1965 stated
that 21 of the original 44 "Phase I" U.S./3rd Country battalions, whose
deployment to Vietnam was accomplished in the latter half of 1965, were
committed to base and installation security. 65/
