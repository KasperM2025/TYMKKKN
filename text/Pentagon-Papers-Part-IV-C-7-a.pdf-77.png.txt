The dilemma. We are in a dilemma. It is that the
situation may be “polar.” That is, it may be that while
going for victory we have the strength for compromise,
but if we go for compromise we have the strength only for
defeat -- this because a revealed lowering of sights
from victory to compromise (a) will unhinge the GVN and
(b) will give the DRV the "smell of blood." The situation
therefore requires a thoroughly loyal and disciplined US
team in Washington and Saigon and great care in what is
said and done. It also requires a willingness to escalate
the war if the enemy miscalculates, misinterpreting our
Willingness to compromise as implying we are on the run.
The risk is that it may be that the "coin must come up
heads or tails, not on edge." 53/

Much of McNaughton's cautious language about the lack of
success -- past or predicted -- of the interdiction efforts appeared
six days later, 2k January, in a memorandum from McNamara for the
President. 5h/ The memorandum recommended (and its tone makes clear
that approval was taken for granted) an increase in the number of
attack sorties against North Vietnam from a level of roughly 3,000
per month -- the rate for the last half of 1965 -- to a level of at
least 4,000 per month to be reached gradually and then maintained
throughout 1966. The sortie rate against targets in Laos, which had
risen from 511 per month in June 1965 to 3,047 in December, would rise
to a steady 4,500, and those against targets in South Vietnam, having
risen from 7,234 in June to 13,114 in December, would drop back to
12,000 in June 1966, but then climb to 15,000 in December. By any
standards, this was a large bombing program, yet McNamara could promise
the President only that "the increased program probably will not put
a tight ceiling on the enemy's activities in South Vietnam," but might
cause him to hurt at the margins, with perhaps enough pressure to
"condition [pin] toward negotiations and an acceptable [to the US/GVN,
that is/ end to the war -- and will maintain the morale of our South

Vietnamese allies."

Most of McNamara's memorandum dealt with the planned
expansion of American ground forces, however. Here it indicated that
the President had decided in favor of recommendations the Secretary
had brought back from his trip to Vietnam on 28 and 29 November, and
had incorporated in memoranda for the President on 30 November and
7 December. 2 These were to increase the number of US combat batta-
‘lions from 34 at the end of 1965 to 74 a year later, instead of to 62
as previously planned, with comparable increases for the Korean and
Australien contingents (from nine battalions to 21, and from one to
two, respectively). Such an increase in US combat strength would raise
total US personnel in Vietnam from 220,000 to over 400,000. At the
same time, McNamara noted in his memorandum of T December, the Depart-
ment of Defense would come before the Congress in January to ask for a
