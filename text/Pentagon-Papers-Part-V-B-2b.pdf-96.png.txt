France and the Associated States in Indo China
and the dispetch of a military mission to pro-
vide close working relations with those forces.
\

I know that all members of the United Nations
will consider carefully the consequences of this
latest aggression in Korea in defiance of the
Charter of the United Nations. A return to the
rule of force in international affairs would have
far reaching effects. The United States will
continue to uphold the rule of law.

I have instructed Ambassador Austin, as the
representative of the United States to the
Security Council, to report these steps to the
Council.
