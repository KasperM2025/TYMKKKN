but is incapable of interdicting all small craft smuggling arms,

The Viet Minh forces have oe resent ability to continue

to occupy the major area of Tonkin (North Vietnam), and to
threaten the two large cities of Zanol and Haiphong. Scattered
elements throughout central and southern Indochina, continue to
have ea harassing ability, preventing peaceful conditions and

the resumption of orderly life and trade. With continued assist-
ance at the present level from Communist China, the Viet Minh
forces will remain a serious threat to the ability of the States
and the French Union Forces to defend and hold the major portion
of Indochina, If massive Chinese Communist armies actually invade

Indochina, such an attack could not be successfully resisted by
the presently available forces and most of Indochina could be over-
run within a matter of, months,

i

The ability of the State and the French Union Forces to
maintain their present positions in Indochina, therefore depends
only upon the absence of an actual Chinese Communist invasion in
force. Their ability to improve their present position, that is,
defense against the Viet Minh as presently augmented by Chinese !
Communist ~add, will depend upon continuing materiel and financial,
aid from France and the United States, and the skill with which
such resources are utilized.

II - POLICY EVALUATION
The policy adopted in NSC 64 and the measures taken to
implement it have made a valuable contribution toward the
stability of Indochina and of Southeast Asia, American military
aid furnished the States' forces and the Army of the French \

Union may have been the decisive factor in the preservation of
the area against Communist aggression.

Future policy with regard to Indochina will be the subject
of new studies now under preparation for the NSC.
