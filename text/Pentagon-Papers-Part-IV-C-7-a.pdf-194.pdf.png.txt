fields kilometers deep rather than the conventional
100-200 meters; the very large numbers and persistent
employment of weapons, sensors, and aircraft sorties
in the barrier area; and the emphasis on rapid and
carefully planned incorporation of more effective
weapons and sensors into the system.

The system that could be available in a year or so
would, in our conception, contain [sic] the following
components:

-- Gravel mines (both self-sterilizing for harass-
ment and non-sterilizing for area denial).

-- Possibly, "button bomblets" developed by Picatinny
Arsenal, to augment the range of the sensors against
foot traffic.*

-- SADEYE/BIU-26B clusters,** for attacks on area-
type targets of uncertain locations.

-- Acoustic detectors, based on improvements of
the "Acoustic Sonobuoys" currently under test
by the Navy.

-- P-2V patrol aircraft, equipped for acoustic
sensor monitoring, Gravel dispensing, vectoring
strike aircraft, and infrared detection of
campfires in bivouac areas.

-- Gravel Dispensing Aircraft (A-1's, or possibly
C-123's)

-- Strike Aircraft

-- Photo-reconnaissance Aircraft

-- Photo Interpreters

--(Possibly) ground teams to plant mines and sensors,

gather information, and selectively harass traffic
on foot trails.

These are small mines (aspirin-size) presently designed to give

a loud report but not to injure when stepped on by a shod foot.
They would be sown in great density along well-used trails, on
the assumption that they would be much harder to sweep than
Gravel. Their purpose would be to make noise indicating pedes-
trian traffic at a range of approximately 200 feet from the

acoustic sensors.
