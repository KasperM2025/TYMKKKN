28. Prospects for aie | ‘ts i ee Initiative from the Viet

Minh: General WNavarre's plan of action calls for "retaking the initi-

‘ative immediately through the carrying out, beginning this summer, of
local offens ives and by pushing to the utmost commando and guerrilla
actions" and "to take the offensive in the north beginning Septenber 15, _
in order to forestall the eneny attack", These planned operations,
previously discussed (and covered in greater detail in Annexes "EZ" and
nun), together. with guerrilla action and the pacification program,

should assure the wresting and retaining of the military initiative

from the Viet Minh. The timing of the major fall offensive is parti-

cularly important. Last dry season's cempaign was scheduled to begin

* about 1 Novenber 1952. The Viet Minh cempaign against the Thai country,

followed by their Laotian. campaign, was initiated on 10 October 1952.
Thereafter, the French merely reacted to Viet Minh attacks, thus
' precluding the initiating of French plenned dry~season operations.
296 Guerri tia Warfare: Geeral Navarre has a strong memory of the
French Resistance movement in Wi II, in which he was active, and told
me that he intended to expand guerrilla activities as one of his immediate
means of retaking the initiative. At the present tims, French-Associated

tates guerrilla operations are loosely organized at command levels end

utilise minor tribal groups in Laos and in Northern and Central Vietnam.

They forma thin defensive harrassment line on the outer perimeter of

Viet Minh influence in the mountains. French estimates of their strength

_ vary from 3,000 to 20,000.
