MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION

I discussed with Foreign Minister Bidault on
Saturday April 25 and with Prime Minister Mayer on
Sunday April 26, the question of raising in the Security
Council the question of the Communist aggression from
Viet Nam against Laos. Both indicated a reluctance to
take this step, a reluctance born out of fear that this
might precipitate a colonial debate.

I expressed the view that the danger of this in
the Security Council might not be as great as in the
General Assembly and that it would probably be possible
to find out in advance what the result would be in the
Security Council, recognizing that Soviet Russia would,
presumably, interpose a veto.

I pointed out that it was difficult to treat this
Indochinese war as an international matter, perhaps to
be discussed between the Soviet Union and the Western
Powers, if the French and the Associated States them-
selves treated it as a purely civil war matter.

I said I had not come to any definitive conclusion
but that I felt the matter should be explored.

Both Mayer and Bidault agreed to such exploration
and to further exchange of views through diplomatic
channels.
