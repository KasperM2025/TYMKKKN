"33, “The French Tactical Air Force, including F&F fighters and B-26
light bombers, appears well organized and employed. The problen--very
much parallel with Korea~-is lack of well defined targets. With an
agsressive ground offensive this picture should change for the better.
It is adequate in the absence of counter air (see Annex mNn) .

34. ‘The Air Transport and Troop Carrier Force is fairly well

- organized, but could employ more efficient techniques, which have been

the lack of sufficient maintenance personnel. This shortage of personnel

exception referred to is lack of numbers of aircraft to airdrop more

than two battalions at one ies. This latter fact was the basis for

the request by the French for a squadron of C-119's. The French state,
however, they are entirely in accord with our recommendation that C-119's

are not feasible for continued operational use in Indochina and, according

“ly, are recommending the withdrawal of their request for the squadron,

as well as agreeing to the immediate removal of the six presently on
loan from FEAF.

35. The requirement still exists, however, for more aircraft if
three infantry battalions are to be sicdranped simultaneously. It
was. recommended to the French, and they agreed, that in the event a
three-battalion drop is projected, enough C-119's to make up the Lift
Seflezeney be leaned to them, subject to high level U.S. approval, for
the three or four days necessary, and that French crews previously
checked as in Germany or elsewhere be on hand in Indochina to make

the drop. These same pilots yould supplement the ‘present C-47 crews
