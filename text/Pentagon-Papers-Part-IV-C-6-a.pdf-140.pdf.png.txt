In summary, despite the wide variations in estimates of infiltration,
recruitment and losses, the data indicate that current enemy recruitment /
infiltration rates and tactics have more than offset the increased friendly
deployments, enabling the enemy to increase his forces in the past and -in
the foreseeable future. If we assume that the estimates of enemy strength
ere accurate, the ratio of total. friendly to total enemy strength has only
increased from 3.5 to 4.0 to 1 since the end of 1965. Under these circum-
stances, it does not appear that we have the favorable leverage required
to achieve decisive attrition by introducing more forces. It may be pos-
sible to reduce enemy strength substantially through improved tactics or
other means such as an effective amnesty/defection program or effective
pacification to dry up VC sources of recruitment, but further large in-
creases in U.S. forces do not appear to be the answer.

Enemy | Offensive Capability. These es timates of enemy strength, losses
and replacement rates raise some important questions. They assume that
the enemy has all of the battalions carried in the MACV Enemy Order of
Battle (OB), and that most of these battalions have retained their offensive
capability. Neither assumption can be supported by available data.

August OB of 175 battalions, only 112 battalions had been positively iden-

corded as to last contact. (The remaining battalions were contacted prior
to period.) Other battalions in addition to the 112 positively identified

the actual existence, or ability to operate, of some of the 59 units with
no records of contact with friendly forces is open to question. Moreover ,
