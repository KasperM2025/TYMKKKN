Following the fall of Dien Bien Phu during the Geneva Conference,
the "domino theory" underwent a reappraisal. On a May 11 press conference,
Secretary Dulles observed that "Southeast Asia could be secured even with-
out, perhaps, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia." In a further remark that was
deleted from the official transcript, Dulles said that Laos and Cambodia
were "important but by no means essential" because they were poor countries
with meager populations. (Tab 2)
