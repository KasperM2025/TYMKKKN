A somewhat similar view was echoed subsequently in a SEACORD con-
ference, the sense of which was reported in a Saigon message to the
Secretary of State. 34/ The relevant arguments were to the effect
that:

(1) The DRV is almost entirely dependent both economically
and militarily woon the Chinese Communists who see great value
in having the DRV continue this exclusive dependence;

(2) <The Soviet Union is the only alternative source of
economic and military support to Hanoi which would enable the
DRV to remain viable if it decided to cease its aggression,

(3) It is therefore important that the Soviets receive
accurate indications that we would not oppose a continuing Soviet
role in the DRV, although this is not a matter on which the U.S.
ean take an initiative.

Subsequent events on the negotiating front, and the role we believed
the USSR could play on that front, also lend support to the view that, at
least in the early part of 1965, there was a fairly widespread belief
among U.S. policy-makers that the Soviet Union could and probably would
exert a benign influence upon Hanoi.

There is, indeed, some evidence that the USSR itself had some such
thought in mind in connection with Kosygin's February visit. Peking,
at least, has charged that Kosygin had tried at that time to persuade
poth Hanoi and Peking to negotiate some kind of settlement with the
United States, reportedly involving a â€œPace-saving" U.S. withdrawal. 35/

In any event, there seems little doubt that the decision to forego
the DESOTO Patrol was inspired by the hope, if not expectation, that
Kosygin would, from the US point of view, weigh in constructively in
the Vietnam struggle. :
