the ARVN has lost prestige in the eyes of the populace, who ere still

worried that the V.C, may return.

Part Cece reeson ror the ineffectiveness of the ARVN is a lack
of suppites and s upport items, such as berbed wire, which the U.S,
forces have in abundance. While more U.S, forces would ae more
barbed wire, that's doing it the hard way. The paci ation progran
depends, instead, on better support for Vietnamese forces and @ more
energetic national Government. This program requires not only time
and patience, bus political and ecencnie progress rather than military
victories
As we sew when Program 4 vas approved, additional forces are a
burden on the South Vietnemese economy, tariation in the first 3 months
of 1967 alone emounted to 20%. Even apart from che rice situation,

in holding down plaster spending. It looks like the Program + Torces

will cost Pu bi illion in 1967, and MACY might be able to hold to Phy
billion in 1968, even waitn inereased forces, Wevertheless, the SVN
economy is stiil far from sound, additional forces would meen slower

civilian and militery personnel on whem we must rely if pacification
is ever to suceeed.
