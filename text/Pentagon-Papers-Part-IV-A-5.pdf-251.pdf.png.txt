",..Particularly after 20 July 1956, the key cadres and Party
members in South Vietnam asked questions which demanded answers:
"Can we still continue the struggle to demand the implementation of
Geneva Agreement given the existing regime in South Vietnam? If
not, then what must be done?' A mood of skepticism and non-confidence
in the orientation of the struggle began to seep into the party
apparatus and among some of the masses.

"At the end of 1956 the popularization of the volume by Comrade
Duan /Le Duan/ entitled "The South Vietnam Revolutionary Path'* was
of great significance because the ideological crisis was now solved.
After analyzing the character of the South Vietnam society, the

Party members with a pair of wings with which to fly and lamps to
shine upon the path ahead, a feeling of encouragement and confidence,
a determined will because the goals were clear and the path bright....

"Since the end of 1958, particularly after the Phu Loi Massacre,
the situation truly ripened for an armed movement against the enemy.
But the leadership of the Nam-Bo Regional Committee at that time
still hesitated for many reasons, but the principal reason was the
fear of violating the party line. The directive of the politburo
in May 1959 stated that the time had come to push the arms struggle
against the enemy. Thanks to this we closely followed the actual
