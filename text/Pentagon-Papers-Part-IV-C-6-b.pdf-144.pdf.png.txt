units compared to a Navy-Marine Support ratio in 1st Corps Tactical

Zone of 1:5.6 men. In view of the different tactical situations (the

I CLZ one was more intensive combat) Heyman was led to conclude that a
detailed review of Army support should be made -- since simply comparing
the ratios suggested that 45,000 men might be adequate for the lst Log
Command or that the Command need not be increased until USARV strength
exceeded 462,000 men. In view of this analysis, Heyman recommended

that Program 4 should be cut to its essentials to "improve the tooth

to tail rate" and that until the review which he had recommended had
been completed the Secretary of Defense should defer approval for deploy-
ment of any First Log Command units through August 1967. 26/

The Secretary of Defense approved this recommendation to defer
further incremental increases to First Log Command and asked the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to prepare a detailed study justifying added increases
and analyzing in depth the Combat Service Support sag ees levels in
South Vietnam. 27/

3. The Quest for Capabilities: The Search for Limits

Great emphasis in May focused upon capabilities, with particular
attention being paid to just what capabilities the services had to pro-
vide troops and units (or equivalents) below the point where they would
be reduced to calling upon reserves or drawing down units already in
Europe. On May 5, Systems Analysis forwarded a brief study to the
Secretary of Defense which analyzed the additional MACV requirements
and compared them to the estimated capability of the services to provide
matching units. The study, which concluded that the services had only
the capability to provide 66,000 of the 186,000 troops requested under
the MACV "Optimum Plan" and only 19 maneuver battalions of the 42
included in that larger plan is presented in the table on the following
pages. 28/
