provided in accordance with operations plans which are acceptable to
the U. S. and are compatible with U. S. capabilities in the light of

4, The U. S, should secure plans from the French and the Asso-
ciated States for, and assist the French and the Associated States in
the prompt acceleration of the formation of new national armies of the
three Associated States (Annex No. 3 contains descriptive information
on the magnitude of such plans). The employment of such armies would
be for the purpose of maintaining internal security with a view to
releasing the bulk of the French forces in Indochina for other duties,
in accordance with the strategic plan for the defense of Indochina.

In due course, as these national armies are able to assume responsi-
pility for the functions of national defense, the U. S. will favor the
phased withdrawal from Tdochina of French forces in order to strengthen
the defense of Metropolitan France under the NATO arrangements. U. S.
and French support for the formation of national armies in Indochina
should be given wide and vigorous publicity. Since it is a policy of
the United States (NSC 48/2) to use its influence in Asia toward resoly-
ing the colonial-nationalist conflict in such a way as to satisfy the
fundamental demands of the Nationalist movement, while at the same time
minimizing the strain on the colonial powers who are,our Western allies,
the U. S. should, for the time being, continue to press the French to
carry out, i letter and spirit, the agreements of March 8, 1949 and

the conventions of December 30, 1949 providing for self-government
within the French Union.
