Had Bao Dai been willing or capable of more effective
leadership, the U.S. role in the war might not have fallen into what
Edmund Gullion called the "pattern of prediction and disappointment‚Äù:

"It can be timed almost to the month to coincide with the rainy
season and the campaign season. Thus, in May or June, we usually
get French estimates of success in the coming campaign season,
based partly on an assessment of losses the Vietminh are supposed
to have suffered in the preceding fall, which are typically
claimed as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy fighting season.
The new set of estimates soon proves equally disappointing; by
October, French Union troops are found bottled up in mountain
defiles far from their bases... There are rumblings about late
or lacking American aid and lack of American understanding.

Some time around the first of the new year, special high-level
United States-French conferences are called. We ask some
questions about the military situation but only a few about
the political situation. There is widespread speculation that
the French may pull out of Indochina if we press them for
explanations of their political and economic program. We
promise the French more aid. The French make a stand: they
claim great casualties inflicted on the enemy. They give us
new estimates for the following campaign season -- and the
round begins once more." 46/

In that bleak pattern, Bao Dai played only a passive role; the "Bao Dai
solution" ultimately solved nothing. The outcome rested rather on France's
military struggle with the Viet Minh, and its contest of leverage with the
United States.
