The White House views the JCS position on intervention

in Indochina as not involving any new policy issue

relative to NSC 5405. However, a pencilled Secretary

of Defense marginal note indicates that the White House

"misses the point" -- the JCS was considering the

"regional grouping" and others in the grouping, i.e.,

U.K. may object to NSC 5405 policy. Hence the JCS is

warning "not to get involved in such a grouping" unless

all parties accept direct action. White House Memo-

Ely emphasizes particular points to Trapnell and Dillon:

(1) Ely was not in accord with O'Daniel's proposal to

reorganize the Vietnamese army on a divisional basis,

(2) O'Daniel's operational war plan was unrealistic,

(3) the increasing frequency of American criticism of

French conduct of the war was not appreciated, (4) Ely

was regrouping his forces for defense of the Delta, and

(5) one or two U.S. Marine divisions could assure

defense of the Delta. Paris 4566 to Dulles, 27 May 1954...... 495

The U.S. Delegation to Geneva clearly sees a forthcoming
settlement which the U.S., under NSC, cannot associate

itself with. Both the dangers of partition and impossi-

bility of armistice supervision in Indochina are recog-

nized. “There is very little that the Defense Depart-

ment can do to influence the negotiations, since 4

political decision has been made that the U.S. will

continue to participate" even though partition will

ultimately result in loss of Indochina to communism.
