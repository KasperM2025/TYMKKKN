1958, in the developing Sino-Soviet dispute, the DRV tended to indorse
Chinese doctrine and methods, but was careful to avoid Peking-style

abuse of the Russians. Ho, on occasion, served as mediator in the dis-
pute, but on such central issues as disarmament, "peaceful coexistence,"
and Moscow's call for "democratic centralism" in the world communist
movement, Ho's view by 1960 approximated that of Mao: independent,
activist and bellicose, at least insofar as Diem's GVN was concerned. gh/
Nonetheless, DRV support for the Soviet Union, qualified though it was,
paid off. In the period 1954 to 1960, the USSR supplanted the CPR as

its prime foreign aid donor:

The foregoing discussion has been confined to the immediate
foreign policy goals of the DRV in the aftermath of Geneva. There remains,
however, a more far-reaching objective: Vietnamese domination over Indo-
china. As mentioned, modern Vietnam is the product of conquest. 96/ The
Khmers (Cambodians) and the tribes along Viet Nam's Laotian frontier have
historic cause for apprehension over Viet forays westward. In the nine-
teenth century, just ahead of French imperialism in Indochina, Vietnamese
forces occupied and annexed contiguous Laotian frontier provinces (those
which were roughly the territory controlled by DRV-linked Pathet Lao in
1963). 91/ But in current era, the furthest reaching of all Viet expan-
sionist aspirations were those of the Communist Party of Indochina (IcP),
which from its foundation aimed at the establishment of political control
over Laos and Cambodia as well as Vietnam, and which regarded a workers
and peasants government over a unified Indochina both feasible and necessary.
According to a Lao Dong Party history published in Hanoi in 1960; "The
Vietnamese, Cambodian, and laotian proletariat have politically and econom-
ically to be closely related in spite of their differences in language,
custom, and race." 98 The history quoted echoes the sense of one of
the earliest known Lao Dong Party directives, captured in South Vietnam,
dated November, 1951, entitled: "Remarks on the Official Appearance of
the Vietnamese Workers Party." In a section labeled "Reasons for the
