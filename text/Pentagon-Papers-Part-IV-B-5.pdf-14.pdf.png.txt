DESCRIPITON

Government troops fire on a Buddhist pro-
test demonstration, killing nine and
wounding fourteen. The incident triggers:
a nationwide Buddhist protest and a
erisis of popular confidence for the
Diem regime. GVN maintains the inci-
dent was an act of VC terrorism.

A five point demand by the Buddhist
clergy is transmitted to the Govern-
ment. It calls for freedom to fly
the Buddhist flag, legal equality
with the Catholic Church, an end

of arrests, punishment of the perpe-
trators of the May 8 incident, and
indemnification of its victims.

U.S. Ambassador Nolting meets with
Diem and outlines the steps the U.S,
wants Diem to take to redress the
Buddhist grievances and recapture
public confidence. These include

an admission of responsibility for
the Hue incident, compensation of the
victims, and a reaffirmation of re-
ligious equality and non-discrimina-

tion.

350 Buddhist monks demonstrate in
front of the National Assembly and
announce a 48-hour hunger strike.

With Nolting on leave, charg√© d'affaires
Truehart meets with Secretary of State
Thuan, and on instruction from the

State Department, warns that U.S.
support for the GVN could not be
maintained if there were another bloody
suppression of Buddhists.

later that day the Government announces
the appointment of an inter-ministerial
committee headed by Vice President Tho
to resolve the religious issue.
