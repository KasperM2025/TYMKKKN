2. MeNamara's Recommendations

Secretary MclNamara's 20 July 1965 Memorandum for the President
spelled out the troop requirements for Vietnam as follows: The forces
for 1965 should be brought up to about 175,000, and "It should be under-
stood that the deployment of more men (perhaps 100,000) may be necessary
in early 1966, and that the deployment of additional forces thereafter
is possible but will depend on developments." 13/

This 100,000-man possible addition was broken down in a cable
fron COMUSMACV to CINCPAC as providing 27 maneuver battalions with
associated combat and service support elements, bringing the total num-
ber of maneuver battalions to 61 sometime in 1966. 14/ The question
arises as to how this 100,000-man 27-battalion figure was reached. In
the absence of documentary evidence, it seems simplest to assume that
Westmoreland was given pretty much what he asked for. However, the 61
battalion figure comes very close to the number of battalions the Secre-
tary of Defense was thinking about earlier in July, when a memorandum
for the record dated 12 July shows a proposal to strengthen U.S. forces
by 63 battalions through a combination of calling up reserves, extending
tours of duty, and increasing the draft. 15/ In fact, the 63 battalion
figure appears again in the Secretary's 20 July memorandum to the
President, allowing one to speculate that the size of the build-up had
already been fixed in early July prior to the trip.

In either case, the result was that Phase II was recommended
- to the President at a level of roughly 100,000 which when added to the
then current estimates for Phase I of 175,000 gave a total estimate of
275,000 by the end of 1965.
