Washington were unproductive since it was impossible to
discuss the actual situation in Indochina, The French
â€˜Government in Paris has not yet been stunned into forthright
and vigorous action, It is my impression that the U.S.
Government has not yet spoken frankly and buntly to the French
regarding Indochina, Consequently, the staff talks should
provide such an opportunity.

The draft statement of U.S. policy in Indochina is
weak from the political side. In the drafting stage the Defense
representatives argued for a strong, hard-hitting policy on
political and economie concessions, The State Department
representatives flatly refused and continued to refuse to consider
Indochina in that manner. Consequently, the paper ended with
a compromise. However, consideration should be given to making
any large scale military, political and economical aid program
conditional - the French talking vigorous political measures
and reforms in Indochina, As it now stands, military aid will
be given when its use appears acceptable to U.S. military
authorities, from the military point of view. The conditional
factor should be introduced with the french on a ministerial
level so that the French Goverment knows of the American
position in this matter, With respect to political measures
and reforms, the Depertment of Defense is beyond this
jurisdiction. However, we should have sepcific measures in
mind since the State Department representatives reiterated
their question "What more can be done in a political way in
Indocihian?"

Finally, we must resolve the problem of influencing the
French to take a number of steps in Indochina, on the one
hand, without our assuming the responsibility for the success
or failure of the overall program to strengthen Indochina's
security.
