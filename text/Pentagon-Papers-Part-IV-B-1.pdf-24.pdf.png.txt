Diem Request

State "First
12-Month Report"

The "Rostow Proposal"

JCSM 717-61

which the VC publicly beheaded
Diem's province chief and escaped
before government troops arrived
and increased infiltration through
Laos demonstrated "that the

tide has not yet turned" militerily.

Diem requested a bilateral treaty
with the U.S, This surprised
Nolting but probably did not sur-
prise the White House, already
warned by White of the grave mili-
tary situation.

This political assessment mirrored
Nolting's "no progress" report but
State found the military situation
more serious than Embassy revorts
had indicated.

Suggested a 25,000-man SEATO force
be put into Vietnam to guard the
Vietnam/Laos border between the DMZ
and Cembodia. (The Pathet Lao had
gained during September, as had VC
infiltration through Laos to the
GVN. This prompted vlans for U.S.
action. )

The JCS rejected the Rostow pro-
posal: forces would be stretched
thin, they could not stop infil-
tration, and would be at the worst
place to oppose potential DRV/CHICOM
invasion. The Chiefs wanted to make
a toncentrated effort in Laos where
a firm stand can be taken saving all
or substantially all of Laos which
would, at the seme time, protect
Thailand and protect the borders

of South Vietnam.‚Äù But if this were
"politically unacceptable" the Chiefs
"provided...a possible limited interim
course of action": deployment of
about 20,000 troops to the central
highlands near Pleiku to assist the
GVN and free certain GVN forces for
offensive action against the VC.
