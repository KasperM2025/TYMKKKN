1930-31, and 1940-41: (1) however eager the people were to take up arms,
insurrection had to be correctly timed in order to exploit both maximum
confusion in enemy ranks and the fullest support from the non-committed;
(2) little faith could bE placed on defectors from enemy forces -- reli-
ance had to rest rather "chiefly on the great masses of the people"; (3)
bases for the support of operations had to be carefully prepared before-
hand. 22/ According to its own histories, the ICP began in 1941 to pre-
pare for a general uprising in Vietnam. In Cochinchina, up until April
1945, the ICP continued to operate largely underground and without much
regard for the Viet Minh mantle; in Tonkin, however, all ICP undertakings
were given Viet Minh identity. Throughout Vietnam, the ICP initiated
patient political action: the dissemination of propaganda, the training
of cadres, the establishment of a network of cells down to hamlet level.
The Central Committee of the ICP adopted this four point program in 1941:

"1. Develop new organizations among the people, and consolidate
those which exist within the Viet Minh.

2. Expand organizations into the cities.

2. Organize the minority peoples within the Viet Minh.

4. Form small guerrilla groups." 23/

The Viet Minh assigned priority to political tasks ahead of military missions.
Cadres were repeatedly impressed with the essentiality of a properly pre-
pared political and material base for guerrilla warfare. Even where the
latter was countenanced, they were enjoined to put "reliance on the masses,
continual growth, extreme mobility, and constant adaptation." ah/ In the
mountainous region of North Vietnam above Hanoi the first permanent Viet
Minh bases were established in 1942-1943. Then followed shadow government
by Viet Minh agents, and in September, 1943, after the people had been
well organized, the first locally recruited guerrilla forces were fromed
under Viet Minh auspices. Not until December 22, 1944, was the first unit
of the Viet Minh Liberation Army created, but cies is little evidence of
concerted guerrilla operations until after March, 1945; by that time the
underground organization was pervasive. As of the end of 194), the Viet
Minh claimed a membership of 500,000, of which 200,000 were in Tonkin,
150,000 in Annam, and 150,000 in Cochinchine. 25/ The aim was for each
village to have a Viet Minh committee, responsive to a hierarchy of com-
mittees; in most instances where the village committee existed, it was

in a position to challenge the government authority. According to Giap,
by 1945 the Viet Minh was the de facto government in many areas:

"There were regions in which the whole masses took part
in organizations of national salvation, and the village Viet
Minh Committees had, as a matter of course, full prestige
among the masses as an underground organization of the revo-
lutionary power." 26/

On 9 March, 1945, the Japanese overturned the Vichy regime in Indo-
china, and set up the Emperor of Annam, Bao Dai, as the head of a state
declared independent of France, but participating in the Greater East Asia
