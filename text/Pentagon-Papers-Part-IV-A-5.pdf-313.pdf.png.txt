The relative importance of Vietnam in the U.S. world-view is
further attested to by the fact that MAAG Vietnam, though limited in
size out of regard for the Geneva Accords 1955-1960, was the only
military aid mission commanded by a Lieutenant General. MAAG
strength was held at 342 (plus 350 personnel in TERM),” but the U.S.
economic aid mission grew rapidly over the years, becoming by mid-
1958, the largest in the world:

However, it has been argued that despite this largesse of treasure,
technical help, and goods, the U.S. failed to provide for Vietnam's
security precisely because its aid emphasized security, rather than
ameliorating those economic and social problems which formed the basis
for popular discontent. It is certainly true that the bulk of U.S.
assistance was concentrated on security. Although from the table
above Military Grants comprised only 25% of the total U.S. program
» 1955-1961, more than 75% of: the economic aid the U.S. provided went
into the GVN military budget. Out of every $10 of U.S. economic aid
the U.S. obligated for Vietnam, about $8 were extended through an
import-subsidization program. The U.S. would purchase goods with
dollars outside Vietnam, sell them to Vietnamese importers for piasters,
and then deposit this local currency in a drawing account for the GVN.
This defense supporting assistance was very crucial to Diem, since
in the period 1956-1960, some 43% of GVN public expenditures were
allocated directly to the military for the armed forces and Self-De--
fense Corps (Scigliano, op.cit., 113).
