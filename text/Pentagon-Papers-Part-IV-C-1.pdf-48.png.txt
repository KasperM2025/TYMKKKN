example of confusion conflicts between USOM and military recommenda-
tions, in cases of recommendations to the government of Vietnam and
Washington concerning the size of the military budget. "Above all,
Lodge has virtually no official contact with Harkins." The Ambassador,
the Secretary felt, simply could not conduct a coordinated administra-
tion-- not because he did not wish to, but because he had "operated as
a loner all his life and cannot nena <lenes now.” Concerning enemy
progress, the report said

Viet Cong progress has been great during the
period since the coup, with my best guess being
that the situation has in fact been deteriorat-

ing in the countryside since July to a far

greater extent than we realized because of undue

dependence on distorted Vietnamese reporting.

The Viet Cong now control very high proportions

of the people in certain key provinces, particu-

larly those directly South and West of Saigon. 27/

As remedial measures he recommended that the government of Vietnam
be required to reallocate its military forces so that its effective
strength in these key provinces would be essentially doubled. There
would also have to be major increases in both the U.S. military staff
and the USOM staff, to the point where the numbers of Americans assigned
in the field would give the U.S. a reliable independent U.S. appraisal.
of the status of operations. (This was a clear enough indication of the
Secretary's unhappiness with past reporting.) Third, he stated that a
"realistic pacification plan" would have to be prepared. Specifically,
they should allocate adequate time to make the remaining government con-
trolled areas secure, and only then work from them into contiguous
surrounding areas,

The Secretary stressed that the situation was worst in the Delta and
surrounding the capitol, and that in the North things were better, and
that General Harkins remained hopeful that the latter areas could be made
reasonably secure late in the year. The report expressed considerable
concern over the increasing infiltration of men and equipment from North
Vietnam. Various proposals to counter this infiltration had been dis-
cussed in Saigon, but the Secretary was not yet convinced that there
were means that were politically acceptable and militarily feasible of
stopping that infiltration.

Minh had strongly opposed any ideas of poeeibie neutralization of
Vietnam. (This was taken to dispose of proposals suggested by Senator
Mansfield, President DeGaulle, the New York Times, columinist Walter
Lippman and others),

Concerning a possible escalation of U.S, effort, the Secretary
indicated that he had directed supply of a modest imeresse in artillery,
but, "US resources and personnel cannot usefully be substantially
increased. ra
