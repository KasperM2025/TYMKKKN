The War in Indochina

We do not make the mistake of treating Korea as an
isolated affair. The Korean war forms one part of the
world-wide effort of Communism to conquer freedom.

More immediately it is part of that effort in Asia.

A single Chinese Communist aggressive front extends
from Korea on the north to Indochina in the south. The
armistice in Korea, even if it leads to a political
settlement in Korea, does not end United States concern
in the Western Pacific area. As President Eisenhower
said in his April 16th speech, a Korean armistice would
be a fraud if it merely release Communist forces for
attack elsewhere.

In Indochina a desperate struggle is in its eighth
year. The outcome affects our own vital interests in
the Western Pacific, and we are already contributing
largely in material and money to the combined efforts
of the French and of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

We Anericans have too little appreciated the
magnitude of the effort and sacrifices which Franoe has
made in defense of an area which is no longer a French
colony but where complete independence is now in the
making. This independence program is along lines which
the United States has encouraged and justifies increased
United States aid, provided that will assure an effort
there that is vigorous-and decisive.
