A CHRONOLOGY OF ROLLING THUNDER MISSIONS

FERRUARY - JUNE, 1965 *

ROLLING THUNDER 1 was scheduled on 20 February 1965 as a one-day reprisal
strike by U.S. and VNAF forces, against Quang Khe Naval Base and Vu Con
Barracks. Two barracks and an airfield were authorized as weather alternates.
ROLLING THUNDER 1 was cancelled because of a coup in Saigon and diplomatic
moves between London and Moscow. ROLLING THUNDER 2, 3, and 4 were planned as
reprisal actions, but subsequently cancelled because of continued political
instability in Saigon, during which VNAF forces were on "coup alerte" Joint
participation with VNAF was desired for political reasons.

The first actual ROLLING THUNDER strike was ROLLING THUNDER 5, @ one-day, no
recycle strike on 2 March 1965. Targets were one ammo depot and one naval
base as primary U.S. and VNAF targets. Four barracks were authorized as
weather alternates. VNAF participation was mandatory. The approved effort
for the week was substantially below the level recommended by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.

ROLLING THUNDER 6 (14-15 March) was a far more foreceful one-day fixed-
target program representing a week's weight of attack. Napalm was authorized
for the first time, but aircraft recycle was prohibited.

ROLLING THUNDER 7 (19-25 March) relaxed the mandatory one-day strike
_execution to a week's period, with precise timing being left to field com-
manders. It included five primary targets with weather alternates. The re-
quirement for concurrent timing of U.S. and VNAF strikes was removed. One
U.S. and two VNAF armed recce missions were authorized during the seven-day
period. Specified route segments were selected in southern North Vietnam
authority was given to strike three fixed radar sites located one «1 cach
route. The strikes were no longer to be specifically related to VC atroci-
ties and publicity on them was to be progressively reduced.

ROLLING THUNDER 8 (26 March - 1 April) ineluded nine radar sites for
U.S. strike, and a barracks for VNAF. The radar targets reflected primarily
policy-level interest in additional purely military targets in southern NVN.
Three armed recce missions were again authorized, against specified route
segments with U.S. armed recce conducted against NVN patrol craft, along the
coast from Tiger Island north to 20° and authority granted to restrike opera-
tional radar sites. VNAF armed recce was conducted along Route 12 from Ha
Tinh to two miles east of Mu Gia Pass.

ROLLING THUNDER 9 (2-8 April) ineugurated a planned LOC interdiction
campaign against NVN south of letitude 20°. The Dong Phuong (JCS
