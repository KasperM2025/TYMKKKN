Komer leaves behind some views
on the war as he leaves for
Vietnam. Negotiations are now
unlikely, but bombing won't make
Hanoi give in, hence the "crit-
ical variable is in the South.”

Amb. Thompson reports the bad
effect of the recent Haiphong
attacks on Soviet attitudes.

Back in the US to speak to LBJ
about his troop request and
address Congress, Westy tells
Johnson, "I am frankly dis-
mayed at even the thought of
stopping the bombing....”

As a part of the policy review
in progress since 24 April,
Bundy writes a strategy paper
opposing more bombing (among
other things) because of the
likely adverse international
effects.

Soviets will likely increase
aid to the DRV but not help
get the conflict to the nego-
tiating table.

Bundy argues for a ceiling on
the US effort in Vietnam and

no further escalation of the
air war, particularly the mining
of Haiphong harbor.

General Wheeler takes sharp
exception to Bundy's views.
Haiphong is the single most
valuable and vulnerable NVN
target yet unstruck. Also
explains the rationale for the
attack on the NVN power grid.
