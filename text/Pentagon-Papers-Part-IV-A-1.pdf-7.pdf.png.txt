on all." Where NATO prescribes action "forthwith," SEATO requires only
that the "common danger" be "met" in accordance with "constitutional
processes." SEATO also forecloses action on the treaty of any threat-
ened state without the consent of that state -~ a qualification designed
to reassure members that their independence was not threatened by neo-
colonialism or other domination in a SHATO guise.

In some respects, however, the SEATO Pact is broader than its NATO
counterparts. The nature of the threat is loosely defined in Article IV
as "any fact or situation that might endanger the peace of the area"
and provision is made to protect threatened member countries of the
region. The area of applicability is left flexible. Moreover, Article
II of the SEATO Treaty applies the pact against not only "armed attack”
but also "subversive activities directed from without against /members/
territorial integrity and political stability." Also, unlike the North
Atlantic Treaty, there is no clause in the SEATO Treaty implying a depen-
dence on United Nations intervention to restore peace once the treaty
were invoked. ‘
