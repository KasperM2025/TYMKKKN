This same document provided an alternative approach to calculating
the minimum essential force. It is quoted in its entirety below, for
it argues that given new objectives (those of preventing military disaster
and providing time for ARVN first to improve and then do its job) the

minimum essential force was 28 battalions smaller than that alread
programmed in Program ERIN ig Again, assuming that the present enemy
threat remained constant.) The approach read:

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO CALCULATING THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL FORCE

U.S. objectives in SVN require U.S. and FWMAF forces
sufficient to prevent military disaster and to provide time
for the ARVN first to improve and then to do its job. This
force is 28 battalions smaller than the Program 4 force for
the present enemy threat.

Before U.S. intervention, the VC decimated and demoral-
ized the ARVN reaction and reserve force by successful
ambushes and attacks. The 17 US/FW battalions deployed by
July 1965 ended the deteriorating trend. In both I CTZ and
II CTZ, VC control over the population peaked by July 1965,
and it declined even earlier in III and IV CTZ.

Since then, the enemy increased from 99 to 151 infantry-
type battalions at the end of December 1966. As of 31 Decem-
ber 1966 we had 98 infantry-type battalions, more than enough
to counter the enemy force considering the intelligence avail-
able. Of the 98 battalions 34 were engaged in TAOR patrol;

46 were engaged in operations that were initiated by hard
intelligence; and the 18 others were predictably unproductive.
The 46 battalions were obviously sufficient to counter the 151
vc/NVA infantry-type battalions, witness the total lack of
enemy success. This suggests that we need 1 battalion for
each 3 enemy infantry-type battalions, in addition to those
needed for static defense. The 18 battalions ineffectively
employed plus the 10 additional infantry-type battalions in
Program 4 that close after January 1, 1967 are enough to
counter 84 additional enemy bns. Thus we need deploy no

more forces until the enemy goes above 235 battalions,

which does not seem to be his present intent. (The enemy
peak was 155 infantry-type bns in July 1966, and was 147

at 31 March 1967).
