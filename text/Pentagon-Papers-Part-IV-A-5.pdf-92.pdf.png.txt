Quoted in Nighswonger, op. cit., 42, from New York Times for
February 13, 1955, p. 1. General Collins, the President's emis-
sary to the GVN, was reported at the same time to be pressing for
a "more reliable armed force chiefly designed to maintain internal
security," with protection from external aggression supplied by
SEATO. Ibid., quoting Baltimore Sun for 1 February 1955, p-.1.

WSC 5612/1, "U.S. Policy in Mainland Southeast Asia," (September 5,
1956), 11, provides that the U.S. will: "assist Free Viet Nam to
build up indigenous armed forces, including independent logistical
and administrative services, which will be capable of assuring
internal security and of providing limited initial resistance to
attack by the Viet Minh." "United initial resistance" was defined
by JCS memo for SecDef, dated 21 December 1956, subject as above,

as follows: "resistance to Communist aggression by defending or

by delaying in such manner as to preserve and maintain the integrity
of the government and its armed forces for the period of time

Government to determine that considerations of national security
require unilateral assistance and to commit U.S. or collective
security forces to support or reinforce indigenous forces in defense
of the country attacked."

U.S., Joint Chiefs of Staff, telegram JCS 974802 of 30 March 1960
to CINCPAC noted increasingly deteriorating internal security in
Vietnam and informed that:

"The JCS agree that anti-guerrilla capability should be developed
within organization of the regular anned forces by changing emphasis
in training selected elements ARVN and other forces from conven-
tional to anti-guerrilla warfare." This cable among many of that
period refocused the MAAG Mission on internal security, and this
became’ the central theme of the military portions of the "Counter-
insurgency Plan for South Viet-Nam" of January, 1961. U.S. Embassy,
Saigon, Despatch No. 276, of January 4, 1961. The MAAG "Country
