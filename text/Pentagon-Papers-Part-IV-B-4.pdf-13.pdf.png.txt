CINCPAC was formally instructed to develop # "Comprehensive
Plan for South Vietnem" (CPSYN) in line with instructions

given at Honolulu.

MACY was directed to draw up a CPSVN designed to ensure GVii
military end para-military etrength commensurate with its
sovereign responsibilities. The CPSVN was to assume the

during the three-yenr
development of full

RVNAF enpebility would be (largely) avallable through the

military assistance program (MAP).

In addition to the CPSVN, MACY prepared an outline for an inte-

grated, nationwide offensive military
insurgency and restore GV¥h control in

campaign to destroy the
South Vietnam. The con-

cept was adopted by the GVYN in hovember.

Diem ordered renlignment of military chain of command, reorgant-
zetion of RYNAF, establishment of four CTZ"s and a Joint
Operations Center to centralize control over current military
operations. (JOC became operational on 20 hecember 1962.)

Although "fragile," the situation In SVN did not appear serious;

Called to review the CPSV.. Largely because of prevailing
optimiom over Vietnam, Mr. Mcliamare found the CPSVN assistance
too costly, the planned withdrawal of US forces too slow and

RVNAF development misdirected.
