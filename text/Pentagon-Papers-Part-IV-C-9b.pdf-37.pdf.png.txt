orders. Second, GV) might steal the initiative from the Buddhists by
making a generous public offer of elections. Whichever course they
followed, State wanted them to be sure it would work and would avoid a
head-on collisicn with the Buddhists. In reply, Lodge agreed on the
need to avoid a head-on collision; as for the means, he, like State,
simply hoped for the best:

We should not settle on one solution or another. Rather it

the Government was in favor of holding these provincial
elections; the offices involved have little actual consequence
but are of symbolic significance; Washington had been informed
of this fact; and if there was some reason why in one or two
provinces they should not be held, then the provinces should
make the reason plain.

5. I then advised that he should take the lead and influ-
