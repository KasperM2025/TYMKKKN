(Another Defector) I was a political officer. I went to
the North just like all the other combatants in my unit. â€”

I believed, at the time, that regroupment was only temporary,
because from the study sessions on the Geneva Agreement we
drew the conclusion that we could return to the South after
the general elections.

(A PW) /Our political officer/ explained that: we were
granted Vietnam north of the 17th parallel now, but in 1956
there would be a general election and we would regain the
South and be reunited with our.families. Because of interest
and curiosity and the opportunity to travel, everyone was

happy. They thought they would be there in the North only
two years and then would be able to return to their homes.
