commitment to resume if they behave.

2. instruct all or selected Corps or division advisors

himself and several other generals on the 22nd, the Young Turks had their
backs up (or were convinced they could do what they pleased), and a11 stood

In a message to the President on the 22nd, Taylor commented:

"Generals acting greatly offended by my disapproval

"T wish to compliment you on the vigor with which you
have pursued this issue of uaity since your return from
Washington." 63/
