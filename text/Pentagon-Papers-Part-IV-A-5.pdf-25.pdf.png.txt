showing a distinct proclivity toward heavy military forces of the
conventional type. He wanted the Civil Guard equipped very much like
his regular army -- possibly with a view to assuring himself 4a check
On army power. There were a few soldiers, like General Duong Van Minh,
who sharply disagreed with the President on this point. Nonetheless,
Diem persisted. His increasing concern for the loyalty of key officials,
moreover, led him to draw upon the military officer corps for civil
administrators. From 1956 on his police apparatus was under military
officers, and year by year, more of the provincial governments were
also placed under military men. By 1958, about 1/3 of the province
chiefs were military officers; by 1960, that fraction had increased to
nearly 2/3; by 1962, 7/8 of all provinces were headed by soldiers.

Diem's bete noire was communism, and he appealed to threats from
communists to justify his concentration on internal security. In
August 1956, GVN Ordinance 47 defined being a conmunist, or working for
them, as a capital crime. In May 1959, by GVN Law 10/59, the enforce-
ment of Ordinance 47 was charged to special military tribunals from
whose decisions there was no appeal. But "communist" was a term not
used by members of the Marxist-Leninist Party headed by Ho Chi Minh,
or its southern arms. Beginning in 1956, the Saigon press began to
refer to "Viet Cong," a fairly precise and not necessarily disparaging
rendition of "Vietnamese Communist." There is little doubt that Diem
and his government applied the term Viet Cong somewhat loosely within
South Vietnam to mean all persons or groups who resorted to clandestine
political activity or armed opposition against his government; and the
GVN meant by the term North as well as South Vietnamese communists,
who they presumed acted in concert. At the close of the Franco-Viet
Minh War in 1954, some 60,000 men were serving in organized Viet Minh
units in South Vietnam. For the regroupments to North Vietnam, these
units were augmented with large numbers of young recruits; a reported
90,000 armed men were taken to North Vietnam in the regroupment, while
the U.S. and the GVN estimated that from 5-10,000 trained men were left
behind as "cadre." If French estimates are correct that in 1954 the
Viet Minh controlled over 60-90% of rural South Vietnam outside the
sect domains, these 5-10,000 stay-~behinds must have represented only a
fraction of the Viet Minh residue, to which GVN figures on recanting and
detained communists in the years through 1960 attest.

From studies of defectors, prisoners of war, and captured documents,
it is now possible to assess armed resistance against Diem much better
than the facts available at the time permitted. Three distinct periods
are discernible. From 195) through 1957, there was a substantial amount
of random dissidence in the countryside, which Diem succeeded in quelling.
In early 1957, Vietnam seemed to be enjoying the first peace it had known
in over a decade. Beginning, however, in mid-1957 and intensifying
through mid-1959, incidents of violence attributed to Viet Cong began
to occur in the countryside. While much of this violence appeared to
have a political motive, and while there is some evidence to indicate
