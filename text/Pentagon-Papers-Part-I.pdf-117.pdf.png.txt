the United National Front called all parties and groups to meet
together and selected Phan Van Hum, as its representative, to
negotiate with the Viet Minh in order to fuse the two fronts
into one.

‘After negotiating, Mr. Hum returned and reported that
the Viet Minh has refused to dissolve into the United National
Front. They state that the Viet Minh is already a consolidated
front in the eyes of the nation and has fought against Japanese
imperialism. Today, in order to unite our strength, the United
National Front has to affiliate with the Viet Minh.

"Since the Viet Minh view point was sound, after hear-
ing Mr. Hum's views, the United National Front affiliated with
the Viet Minh...’

"Tran Van Giau - 'The Viet Minh does not wish to race for
power. If a man is able, no one will stand in his way. The
United National Front represents many parties and groups which
are affiliated to the Viet Minh...'" 32/

Although the 30 August meeting produced no formal merger, on 7 September
1946 the Viet Minh was able to announce the forming of a "national bloc
committee” with the United National Front. It was Tran Van Giau's Com-
mittee of the South which was the de facto government in Saigon when the
British occupation forces arrived.
