101554 SENATOR MANSFIELD ISSUED A REPORT ON INDOCHINA. IT SPOKE OUT SHARPLY
AGAINST PLANS TO REPLACE DIEM, IF DIEM WAS OVERTHROWN THEN THE U.S.
SHOULD CONSIDER AN IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF ALL AID TO VIETNAM AND THE
FRENCH UNION FORCES THERE, EXCEPT THAT OF A HUMANITARIAN NATURE.
MANSFIELD DEFENDED DIEM ON THE GROUNDS THAT HE HAD A REPUTATION THROUGH-
OUT VIETNAM FOR INTENSE NATIONALISM AND EQUALLY INTENSE INCORRUPTIBILITY.
HE DENOUNCED THE INCREDIBLE CAMPAIGN OF SUBVERSION BY INTRIGUE AND THE
CONSPIRACY OF NON-COOPERATION AND SABOTAGE THAT HAD STOOD IN THE WAY OF
DIEM'S FORGING AHEAD WITH HIS PROPOSED CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM. /U.Ss.

101954 IN MEMO TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, JCS ELABORATED ON THE JUSTIFICATION FOR
INCREASED VIETNAMESE ARMY. SEATO DID NOT PROVIDE FOR MILITARY

VIETNAM OBJECTIVE WAS THE LIMITED DEFENSE OF THE 17TH PARALLEL TO DETER

TO TRAIN SOUTH VIETNAMESE WITH ONLY A 342-MAN MAAG. BUT IF TRAINING WAS
NECESSARY, THEY FELT THAT FRANCE "HANDS OFF" WAS ESSENTIAL. /JCS HIST.

PROGRAM INVOLVING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF FREE VIETNAMESE FORCES,
EMPHASIZING THE INTERNAL SECURITY MISSION. /sSCS HIST.
