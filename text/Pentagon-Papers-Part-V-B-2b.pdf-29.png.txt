true. The U.S. believes that France will stay in Indochina

ing their EDC commitments: (1) the French effort in Indo-
china, (2) financial difficulties and whether the strategic
importance of SEA justified continued effort, and (3) Indo-

cannot continue to bear “alone such great share Indochinese
burden.” French attach great importance to U.S. aid.
