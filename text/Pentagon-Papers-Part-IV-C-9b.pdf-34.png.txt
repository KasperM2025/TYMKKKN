Directly after the conference USOM remained seriously concerned about
the high and rising black market piaster rate for dollars, which they and
the Vietnamese business community regarded as the bellweather of infletion.
Moreover, besides its harmful psychological effect, the high rate tempted

militery pacification efforts. Upon his return to Saigon, Lodge issued
a memorandum reconstituting the Mission Liaison Group under Deputy

tionary Development, Porter saw his responsibility as primarily a coor-
dinating effort. He said he did not intend to get into individual agency
activities. 40/
