Indochina War culminated in Viet Minh military victory and the
Geneva Conference of 1954, but during it a Vietnamese government
under Bao Dai, like Ho Chi Minh's DRV claiming dominion over all
the Vietnamese, but Nationalist, anti-Communist, and French-
supported, came into being. From 1949 on, this nascent state
provided the political alternative to the DRV; it was Bao Dai's
regime which inherited South Viet Nam, and a counterclaim to a
unified nation, after the 1954 Geneva settlement. (Fall, The Two
Viet_Nams, op. cit., 210-223).

The United States recognized Bao Dai's regime, the GVN, on
February 7, 1950. We had no relations with the DRV, although for
six months after the departure of the French from the DRV in 1955,
we maintained a vice-consulate in Hanoi, withdrawing it after
persistent DRV isolation and harassment. Since, the United States
has maintained full relations with GVN, but not even a postal
exchange with the DRV. (JIbid.; 191, 194). However, although no
formal U.S. recognition has been extended, we have acknowledged DRV
sovereignty, at first implicitly, and then, after 1962, explicitly.
At the Geneva Conference in 1954, the U.S. "observer" related U.S.
policy toward the DRV to that we have pursued re North Korea and
East Germany. U.S. recognition of, consistent relations with, and
increasingly strong support of the GVN after Geneva, were not accom-
panied by public policy statements more directly aimed at changing
the status quo in North Viet Nem than that 1954 position. However,
national policy papers of the period included the more ambitious
objectives quoted.
