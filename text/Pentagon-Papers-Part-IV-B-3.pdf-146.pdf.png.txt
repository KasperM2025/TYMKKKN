The first review (completed in March) cut two marginal navy vessels

from the list of U.S. supported wits, but only warned JGS of the unaecept -
able effectiveness of two marginal ranger battalions and an armored cavalry
squadron. The June review, while producing recommendations from U.S,
advisors that aid be suspended in several cases, again resulted only in
warnings and threats. There was no suspension of U.S. support.

RVNAF EFFECTIVENESS

Quantitative efforts to rate RVNAF effectiveness continued in the
field, at MACV, and in Washington throughout the year with no clear
agreement on what set of statistical indicators best portrayed RVNAF
performance and potential. During 1966 MACV had relied on a minimum
present for duty strength as a means of evaluating ARVN battalion effec-
tiveness. This method permitted wide fluctuations and was unreliable.
The 1967 statistics on RVNAF desertions revealed an improving ability of
units to hold their men. MACV soon began to use this trend as an indi-
cator of effectiveness. In May, for instance, COMUSMACV noted with
satisfaction the marked reduction of January and February 1967 desertions
compared to desertions in the same period in 1966. The average improve-
ment for this period was about 50 percent:

Desertions/Rates (per 1000 assigned) 195/

January February
1966 9,251/16.0 14,110/24.3
1967 5,900/9.6 5,860/9.6

In the same message, MACV noted with satisfaction recent aggressive
actions by the JGS to correct the unacceptably high incidence of deser-
tions, including the Singling out of three regiments for special warning
on their excessive desertion rate. Year-end statistics compiled by OSD
Systems Analysis indicate that the figures quoted by MACV in May erred

on the optimistic side somewhat by undercounting RF desertions in both
months by about 1,000, Nevertheless, the trend to which MACV was pointing
was confirmed during the rest of the year. After rising slightly to

8,127 in March, RVNAF desertion rates leveled off at between about 6,000 -
{,000 per month for the remainder of 1967. 196/ Thus, 1967 produced only
80,912 desertions compared with 117,740 in 1966, an overall reduction of
almost one-third. 197/ (It also should be noted in passing, that vc/NVA
desertions reached a peak in March and thereafter fell off sharply. )
