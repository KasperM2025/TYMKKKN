offensive by greatly increased efforts to pacify the country-
side end increase the attractive power of the GVN - all these

This strategy is also well suited to exploiting any possibili-
ties of a Hanoi/NLF split." 23/

To achieve these objectives, nine program areas each "requiring a
maximum continuing effort" were listed. These included pacification,
mounting a major national reconciliation program, pressing for emergence
of a popularly based GVN, continuing to strive for other objectives of
the Manila Program (local government, land reform, anti-corruption), and
keeping the lid on the economy. More relevant to our concerns were the
four directly concerned with the land war:

"B. Step up the Anti-Main Force Spoiling Offensive, as

made feasible by the increase in FW maneuver batbalions.

1. Introduce modest US forces into certain key
Delta areas.

and LOCs around Saigon.

3- lay on @ major re-examination of our intelligence

"GC. Make More Effective Programs to Iimit Infiltration
