DESCRIPEION

withdrawal, and dissociates

the U.S. from Diem's repressive
policies. It does not, however,
announce the aid suspensions.

CAS agent Conein "accidently"
meets General Don at Tan Son
Nhut.Â° Don asks him to come to
Nha Trang that evening. With
Embassy approval Conein keeps
the appointment. Don states
that there is an active plot
among the generals for a coup,
and that General Minh wants to
see Conein on Oct 5 to discuss
details. The key to the plan,
according to Don, is the conver-
sion of ITI Corps Commander,
General. Dinh.

The President approves detailed
recommendations of the McNamara-
Taylor mission for transmission
to Lodge.

" ..President today approved
recommendation that no initiative
should now be taken to give any
active covert encouragement to

a coup. There should, however,
be urgent covert effort...to
identify and build contacts with
possible alternative leadership
as and when it appears."

With Lodge's approval, and
probably before receipt of
foregoing message, Conein meets
with General Minh. Minh says
he must know the U.S. position
on & coup in the near future.
The GVN's loss of popular sup-
port is endangering the whole
war effort. Three possible plans
are mentioned, one involving
assassination. Conein is non-
commita.l.
