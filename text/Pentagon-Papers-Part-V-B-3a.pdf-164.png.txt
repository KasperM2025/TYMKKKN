REPORT TO THE NATION BY THE HONORABLE JOHN FOSTER
DULLES, SECRETARY OF STATE, AND THE HONORABLE
WALTER S. ROBERTSON, ASSISTANT Saaee OF STATE,
FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1953

..-Last Tuesday night we finished a five-day meeting
of the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, and the
United States....

. . . . . -* . .

In the past, there has been some criticism of the
French Republic for failing to promise liberty and
independence to the three Associated States of Indo-
china, -- Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. It was felt that
the peoples of these countries needed something of their
own for which to fight. The basis for that criticism
should now be removed. The French Government has given
assurance that it stands ready to grant complete sover-
eignty and independence to the three Associated States.
Negotiations on this matter will start in the near
future.

Last Monday, Mr. Bidault, the French Foreign
Minister, and I invited the representatives of these
three States to meet with us. We found that they looked
forward eagerly to working out arrangements with the
French Government to complete their sovereignty and
independence. It seemed that they do not want to be
wholly divorced from France. They have, with France,
strong bonds of a cultural, economic and military nature.
These can be preserved, consistent with full independence,
within the French Union, which, like the British Common-
wealth, offers a possibility of free association of
wholly independent and sovereign nations.

This action of the French Government makes clear
the distinction between those who would grant inde-
pendence and those who would destroy it. It should

make it easier to stop Communist agsression in that

part of the world.
