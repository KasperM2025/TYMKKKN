As of 1963, 80% of the Party were members of 10 years or more, less than
10% were women, and no more than 7% were non-Vietnamese. Although an
elite, the Party admitted in 1960 that 85% of its members had no more
than 4th grade educations. lack of skill and drive, as well as inade-
quate strength, handicapped the Party in its attempts to encadre the
DRV's ambitious agricultural and industrial programs. From the 1960
admissions, it appears that of 110,000 managerial personnel in the DV,
only 50,000 or so were Party members; about 10% of the Party is then
employed directly in management. Nonetheless, the Party has from all
appearances succeeded in lodging itself in pivotal positions in every
part of the society, and certainly in the DRV's main undertaxings.

b. Fatherland Front

One of the fundamental procedures of the Vietnamese Con-
munists has been the forming of a "united: front" in which Communist
Party menbers join cause with non-comunists, especially nationalist
activists. The Party itself has pointed out that this is in proper
Leninist fashion: :

"The policy of founding the Indochinese democratic front
between 1936 and 1939, the Viet Minh front between 1941 and
1951, and the Lien Viet front /1946-1951/; the decision of
signing the 6 March 19)6...preliminary accord /Ho's accom-
modation with France/... -- all these are typical examples
of the clever application of the...instruction of Lenin." 11/

In 1955 the DRV organized non-comaunist elements into "mass
organizations," within the "Fatherland Front" (Mat Tran To Quoc). 12/
