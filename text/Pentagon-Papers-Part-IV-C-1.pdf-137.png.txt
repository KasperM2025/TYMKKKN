Although some HOP TAC progress was occasionally reported the pacification
situation otherwise was quite gloomy. The Vietnam Sitreps of 3 March 1965
reported the nationwide pacification effort remained stalled, The HOP TAC
program "continues but personnel changes, past and future, may retard the
future success of this effort." The 10 March Sitrep called the national paci-
fication effort "stagnated" and objectives in some areas "regressing." In
the I and IT Corps pacification has "all but ceased." Only a few widely
scattered places in the rest of the country could report any achievement.

In the HOP TAC area the anticipated slow-down in pacification had arrived

-- the result of shifting military commanders and province and district chiefs.
On 17 March, pacification was virtually stalled, refugee problems were mount-
ing in I and II Corps. Only in the HOP TAC area were there "modest gains...

in spite of increased VC area activity." By 24 March the word used for
pacification efforts generally was "stalled," and the effort had now become
increasingly devoted to refugee centers and relief, However, the Sitrep

said 356 hamlets in the HOP TAC area had been reported -- by Vietnamese
authorities -- as meeting agreed criteria and 927,000 persons were living

in zones that had been declared clear, 11/

At the time of the Johnson Mission, concern over the evident failures
of the pacification program was such that proposals to change the frame-
work within which it was conducted -- proposals to put the USOM, USIS and
CIA pacification operations all under MACV ~-- were examined at length.
Ambassadors Taylor and Alexis Johnson as well as General Westmoreland were
opposed to sweeping changes of this sort. All apparently conceded the need
for better coordination of the different kinds of programs, military and
civil, which went into pacification but senior mission officials strongly
opposed any major revision of the non-military effort.
