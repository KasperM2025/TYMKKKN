d. The China Aid Program

In the meantime, U.S. policy suffered. a setback in Asia.
A China Aid Program had been enacted by Congress in June, 1948, in the
same omibus foreign assistance legislation which authorized ERP and ECA.
The China Aid Program met almost immediate failure, for Mao's armies spread
unchecked. over the China mainland, and by late 1949, the position of the
Nationalists there was untenable. This "failure" of U.S. aid -- it was
termed such by Congressional critics -- no less than the urgent situation
in Europe figured in Congressional action on military assistance legisla-
tion placed before it in 1949. 11/

e. MDAP, 1949

device. On October 6, 1949, Congress passed the Mutual Defense Assistance
Act, designed as a comprehensive law, providing a Mutual Defense Assistance
Program (MDAP) through which U.S. arms, military equipment and training
assistance might be provided for collective defense. In the first appro-

by Furnishing Military Assistance to Foreign Nations,
Approved. October 6, 1949.

"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this
Act may be cited as the 'Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949.'
