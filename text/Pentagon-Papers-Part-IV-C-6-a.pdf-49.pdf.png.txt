E. McNamara Goes to Saigon - A Decision on IIA
1. McNamara Visits Saigon

Faced with this changed enemy situation, Secretary of Defense
McNamara diverted his return from a NATO meeting in Paris to allow him
to visit Saigon on 28-30 November. As outlined in the Secretary of
Defense's 23 November cable to Saigon, the purpose of the trip was
"further discussion of Phase II requirements." 35/ Specifically, he
asked: "Will it not be necessary to add one or two divisions to the 28
battalions proposed in order to provide forces for the Delta; will even
more forces be required in 1966 if the number of PAVN regiments continues
to increase?"

2. Westmoreland's Recommended Add-Ons

According to the MACV Command History, when Secretary McNamara
arrived in Saigon, "COMUSMACV expressed a need for an additional division
(which could be ROK) for deployment along the coastal plain in II CYTZ,
thereby freeing the 4th Infantry Division...for operations further
inland. Another USA division was needed for employment in the Upper
Delta in the area contiguous to Saigon, for a total of three USA divi-
sions around the capital city. A separate brigade for FFORCEV was
necessary to reinforce the 1st Cavalry Division (AM)...Two air cavalry
squadrons were needed to support the 4th Infantry Division and the
ist Cavalry Division (AM), as was another airmobile infantry battalion
for the 1st Cavalry Division (aM) to give that division a balanced force
of three 3-battalion brigades." This revised deployment plan was referred
to as Phase IIA (add-on). 36/

Secretary McNamara was told that the Free World battalions requested
for the end of CY 1966 and ARVN would be used for the major tasks in the
following proportions:

FUMAF ARVIN

Defense of Major U.S. Bases 29 Si
Defense of Government Centers and -- 68
