EVENT OR
DATE DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION

7 Feb 65 McGeorge Bundy Bundy felt the GVN would collapse by
Memorandum for 1966 witlout substantially more U.S.
the President help and action. To avert collapse

and to counter latent anti-Americanism
and the growing feeling among Viet-
namese that U.S. was going to quit,
Bundy recommended a policy of gradu-
ated, continuing air strikes against
North Vietnam. He did not mention a
base security problem; he did not
suggest deployment of U.S. ground
troops -- then or in the future.

(This document -- and the absence of
others -- supports the interpretation
that the forthcoming Marine deployment
to Da Nang was intended as a one-shot
response to a particularly serious
security problem, not as the first in
â€˜a planned series of U.S, troop com-
Ynitments.)

7 Feb 65 McNamara News The Secretary announced elements of a
Conference USMC HAWK missile battalion would be
deployed to Da Nang to improve security
against air attack.

11 Feb 65 JCSM 100-65 A proposal for the first eight weeks of
military action against North Vietnam.

As expected, air strikes were paramount
but the JCS recommended collateral de-
ployment of a Marine Expeditionary
Brigade (MEB) to Da Nang and an Army
brigade to Thailand -- not for counter-
insurgency duties but to deter overt
DRV/CHICOM retaliation to the air
.strikes, to improve U.S. ability to
respond if retaliatory attacks were
launched.

18 Feb 65 SNIE ; A new incredient in the still critical

situation in South Vietnam was to be
ait the inauguration of the Rolling Thunder

air campaign. This evaluation showed
Viet Cong attacks against U.S. bases
would probably. continue at about their
present level of intensity despite in-
creased air action against North Vietnam.
