On 2 November General Westmoreland observed that in September the Mission
had been preoccupied with the problem of keeping RVNAF intact in the face

of internal dissention and political and religious purges but by late
November he was pleased at the way the RVNAF had weathered the political
storm and encouraged by increased RVNAF strength because of volunteers and
enlistments. RVNAF strength of 31 October was compared to figures for

30 April: 230,474 RVNAR, up from 207,41; 92,265 Regional Forceg up from
85,660; 159,392 Popular Forces, up from 96,263. During September and October,
RVNAF and Regional Forces officers and NCOs to the rank of first corporal had
received a 10% increase in basic pay; the lowest three enlisted grades in
these forces -- plus all Popular Force personnel -- had received 500 more
piastres per month. Cost of living increases to NCOs matched those given to
officers. Subsector U.S. advisory teams (two officers, three enlisted men)
were operating in some 75 districts, General Westmoreland reported HOP TAC
was progressing slowly. Civil-military-political planners were working to-
gether; the Saigon-level coordinating group, the HOP TAC Council, was
operating. =* :

General Westmoreland summarized the key issues as he viewed them at the
time, First, there was a need to establish concrete but attainable short-
range goals to give momentum; second, more effective means of asserting U.S.
policy and plans for the pacification program at the Saigon level was needed;
third, the U.S. should take a positive position against external support of
the insurgency. 133/

Also on 2) Novenber, Westmoreland recommended an increase in RVNAF
force structure and requested its early approval to permit official negotia-
tions with the GVN, to facilitate MAP plenning. This recommendation fol-
lowed a joint U.S./GVN survey and a COMUSMACV staff study. Two alternative
levels of increase were proposed:

Already Increase New Total
Authorized IATA de Alt 2 Alt 1 ALE 2
RVNAF 2h3,599 30, 309 47,556 273,908 291,155
Para Mil No alt. for Para. 322,187
Mil,
212,246 109,941

The increase in U.S. advisors for the two alternative programs would
be 446 and 606, respectively, The first (the lower) alternative was sup-
ported by theJCS on 17 December 196) and approved by Secretary McNamara
on 13 January 1965. This January decision raised the total U.S. military
personnel in Vietnam from 22,309 to 22,755. 134/
