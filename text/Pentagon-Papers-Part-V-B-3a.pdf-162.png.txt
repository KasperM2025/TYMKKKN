9. How could guch a maneuver be undertaken? Once
more it would be logical to see to it that the work

of the conference progresses pari passu with a cease-
fire in Indo-China.

In any case, it is only fair that the work
of the political conference should, at the very least,
be conducted in such a manner that Communist China:

(a) can not consider any result as secured (in
particular with regard to the evacuation of
military forces) as long as she has not
given tangible proof of her general goodwill
in Southeast Asia.

(b) receives the impression that the situation
in the Far East as a whole is kept constantly
under review by the Three Powers jointly
and therefore has a direct influence on
negotiations which are limited to Korea
in principle.

(c) arrives gradually at the conclusion that her
best interest is to cut down her support of
the Vietminh, in order to enjoy the benefits
which she might expect to derive from a
prolonged or final cessation of hostilities
on the 38th\paralle.

£0: At the same time, the French Government would
continue its efforts to obtain a satisfactory adjustment
of the situation in Indo-China, which has just been
undertaken both on the political and on the military
level. Such an adjustment should enable us to regain
the initiative in military operations just as we have
regained it with respect to relations’ between Frence
and the Associated States.
