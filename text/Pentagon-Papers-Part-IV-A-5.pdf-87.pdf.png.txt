1957,” (NIE 63-56, 17 July 1956), 10. A thesis advanced by Bernard
Fall that the Viet Minh deliberately sent the families of the stay-
behinds north, so that the hard-core regulars who remained in the
south could engage in "mobile warfare, without having to worry about
reprisals against their relatives," has not been substantiated in
recent interviews with Viet Cong. Fall, The Two Viet-Nems, op. Clb ay

in South Vietnam," (Research Memorandum RFE-49, November 9, 1966),
SECRET, iii. Fall once accepted a figure of 120,000, but later tended
to a ceiling of 100,000. Cf., Fall in Lindholm, ed.,; Viet-Nam,

op. cit., 57; and Fall, Vietnam Witness, op. cit., 216. The 130,000
total approximates the figures published by the Research Staff of the
Council on Foreign Relations in 1956; 150,000 Viet Minh troops and
their families. a/ Wilfred G. Burchett, the Australian communist,
has referred to “the withdrawal of the 140,000 Viet Minh and the
eadres to the north." b/ ‘The statistic usually used in U.S. official
publications -- for example in the 1965 White Paper -- is 90,000 Viet
Minh troops moved north, and this is commonly regarded as an invaluable
reservoir for the DRV's subsequent infiltration of South Vietnam. ¢
But the dimension of this resource extended beyond 90,000 "“varriors."
There were Montagnards who proved particularly useful in building and
protecting the infiltration routes down through the Taotian and Viet-
namese Highlands. There were also children, 4n obvious long-range
asset. a/ The DRV set up a special school for southern Montagnards,
and some 1} elementary and higher schools were reserved for other
southern children. e/ Moreover, there is evidence. that the Viet Minh
systematically broadened its family ties in the South through hundreds
of hasty, directed marriages for departing "Jarriors” and by recruiting
very young men and boys just before departure. f
