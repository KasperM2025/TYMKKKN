fall of 1946, engaged first by the abortive Fontainebleau negotiations
and then by their aftermath, the modus vivendi he signed with France
on 14 September 1946. During Ho's absence, Vo Nguyen Giap -- Acting
Minister of the Interior and Minister of National Defense -- policed

other "opposition" parties to survive -- suitably disarmed and manned
with cooperative nationalists -- within the Lien Viet. The Lien Viet
proceeded to forge new "unity" within the Front, and to tighten Front
control over the DRV. On Ho's return, the National Assembly was called
back into session, presented with a reorganized government and a new

constitution.
