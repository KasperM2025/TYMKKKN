President Diem's plan to rebuild the coastal highway to Hue, and
succeeded in asserting priority for a road into the Pleiku area
of the Highlands. General Williams acceeded to only so much of
the Saigon-Hue road (Highway No. 1) as extended to Bien Hoa (some
20 miles north of Saigon) because "there is no road out of Saigon
now that could take care of heavy military traffic and will not
be until Bien Hoa Highway is completed."*

The 20-mile stretch of highway to Bien Hoa cost more money

than all project aid allocated for labor, cammunity development,
social welfare, health, and education in the years 1954-1961.**
