ANNEX NO. 3

INFORMATION ON THE FORMATION OF NATIONAL
ARMIES OF THE ASSOCIATED STATES

1. General Corisiderations. The organization and utilization
of manpower in the non-Communist countries of Asia is possibly the
key to the successful development of the security of Indochina and
of Asia. In several years of warfare, the French have discovered
that the Vietnamese fighting for Ho Chi Minh provided tough and per-
sistent forces. The military campaign in Korea has demonstrated that
Koreans can handle modern weapons and ccnduct sustained offensive and
defensive operations. It may be presumed that Communist China, under
the tutelage of often reported Soviet assistance, in developing inte-
grated armies along modern lines. In addition, it would appear that
Communist China has, for some time, actively benefited the North Korean
armies and now is training and equipping the Viet Minh for operations
in Indochina. The basic problem for the western powers is to find ways
and means to utilize the manpower resources of Asia in order that the
military forces of the west are not committed to actions in areas of
limited or less strategic importance.

2. Whe French Position. On 17 August 1950, U.S. Ambassador Bruce,
in Paris, reported to the Department of State that Premier Pleven, in
discussing with him the situation in Indochina, had stated that (a) the
only possible solution was to build up a strong and sufficient native ;

army to make possible the gradual withdrawal of the French army for use
