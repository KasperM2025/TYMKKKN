The requirements for 1966 had been adjusted to 474,786 bringing
the year-end totals for 1966 and 1967 to 395,269 and 436,406, although
the maneuver battalion strength remained at 79 U.S. battalions (this did
not include the windfall of the 3 battalions of the 196th Brigade). The
CINCPAC submission also reiterated the request made in February for 20
battalions to reconstitute the PACOM reserve.

The requirements for CY 1967 were basically considered to be
"rounding out forces." This force package basically consisted of:
2 tactical strike squadrons; 11 U.S. maneuver battalions of infantry/
armored cavalry/tank configuration; a 4th rifle company for each of the
61 U.S. infantry battalions, and 7 FWMAF battalions, 6 of which were to
round out the ROK Marine Brigade to a Division, and 1 additional battalion
for the Australian Task Force to round it out to a full regiment. After
all of the deployments recommended in the plan were carried out, the
strength of U.S. forces in Vietnam would be 90 maneuver battalions and
542,588 personnel.

2. JCS Recommendations

These requirements were forwarded to the Secretary of Defense
by the JCS in JCSM 506-66, on 5 August. 3/

The memorandum noted that the JCS felt that with a few excep-
tions the requirements and proposed force additions were valid, and
that a capabilities planning conference was scheduled for early October
to "correlate this planning into a comprehensive program."

3. Secretary. of Defense Directs Studies

On the same day, the Secretary of Defense sent a memorandum to
the Chaimen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as follows:

5 August 1966
MEMORANDUM FOR CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

SUBJECT: CINCPAC CY 1966 Adjusted Requirements & CY 1967
: Requirements (U)

As you know, it is our policy to provide the troops, weapons,
and supplies requested by General Westmoreland at the times he
desires them, to the greatest possible degree. The latest revised
CINCPAC requirements, submitted on 18 June 1966, subject as above,
are to be accorded the same consideration: valid requirements for
SVN and related tactical air forces in Thailand will be deployed
on a schedule as close as possible to CINCPAC/COMUSMACV's requests.
