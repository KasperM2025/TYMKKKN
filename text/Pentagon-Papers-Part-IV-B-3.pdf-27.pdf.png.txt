McGeorge Bundy informed Amb.
Taylor that President wanted
to try "encadrement of U.S.
troops with Vietnamese."

DOD requested COMUSMACV's
opinion about feasibility of
encadrement of U.S. officers
in ARVN divisions to improve
effectiveness.

Based on study by Gen. Throck-
morton, encadrement proposals
were rejected because of
language problem, expanded
support requirement, and adverse
effects on South Vietnamese
morale.

Westmoreland suggested joint
MACV-JGS staff. Gen. Thieu and
Gen. Minh were opposed.

Corps commanders for I, IT, IV
Corps presented Hop Tac plans
for their zones, each to extend
"oil blot" pacification from its
headquarters city. (By end of
1965 became scheme for Netional
Priority Areas.)

Viet Cong attached and overran
Song Be, capital of Phuoc Long
Province, and @ U.S. advisory
compound in the city.

McNamara authorized creation of
formal combined command in Viet-
nam and coordinating MACV-JGS
staff.

Westmoreland recommended against
proposed combined command because
of Thieu's and Ky's opposition.

CINCPAC supported COMUSMACV's
opposition to combined command
because of fears of Vietnamese
hostility.
