Viet Minh insistence on a political solution before a cease-fire. The
ability of the Chinese and Soviets to overcome DRV resistance on this point
was very encouraging early in the proceedings. Russia and China were active
behind the scenes on the question of partition, with Russia taking the ini-
tiative even before the conference began, and with both major powers in-
fluencing the decisions as the French and Viet Minh moved toward a mutually
agreeable demarcation line. The common-sense role that the USSR and China
played with reference to Pathet Lao and Free Khmer inclusion brought about
a key concession that had nearly stopped the conference -- the need to
separate the Vietnam question from the rest of Indochina. The final diffi-
cult question, the composition and function of the Control Commission,
dragged along for several weeks, but was finally solved with no little
assistance of the USSR and China. . j
