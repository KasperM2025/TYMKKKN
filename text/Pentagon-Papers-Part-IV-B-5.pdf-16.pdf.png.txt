DESCRIPTION

Buddhists protest activities intensify
as leadership passes from the dis-
eredited moderate, older leaders to
younger militants. The Saigon press
corps is actively cultivated.

President Kennedy, visiting in Ireland,
announces the appointment of Henry
Cabot edge as the new U.S, Ambassador
to South Vietnam, effective in Septem-
ber.

Vice President Tho's committee announces
that a preliminary investigation of

the May 8 incident has confirmed that
the deaths were the result of an act

of VC terrorism.

At a State Department briefing for the
President it is generally agreed that
Diem will not voluntarily remove Nhu.

A discussion of the likely consequences
of a coup reveals divergent views.

Having cut short his vacation to re-
turn to Washington for consultations,
Nolting confers with Under Secretary
of State George Ball and voices the
fear that an attempt to overthrow Diem
would result in a protracted religious
civil war that would open the door to
the Viet Cong. We should not abandon
Diem yet. While in Washington he also
sees Secretary McNamara.

This special intelligence estimate notes
coup rumors in Vietnam and warns that
@ coup would disrupt the war effort
and perhaps give the Viet Cong the
opportunity for gains they had been
hoping for. It concludes, however,
that if Diem does nothing to implement
the June 16 agreements, Buddhist un-
rest will continue through the summer
and increase the likelihood of a coup
attempt.
